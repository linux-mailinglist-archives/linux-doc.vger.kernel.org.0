Here is the inventory I promised, from checktransupdate.py on mainline:

  zh_TW:  51 translated files, all out of date
          221 distinct English commits to catch up with

    process/      14 files
    admin-guide/  15
    arch/         12
    dev-tools/     5
    filesystems/   3
    cpu-freq/      1
    index.rst      1

For calibration I ran the same tool on zh_CN: 178 translated files,
also all out of date, 639 distinct commits behind. So in terms of
drift from the English originals, zh_TW is not in a categorically
different state from zh_CN -- the real gap is coverage (51 vs 178
files), not decay. That makes me more optimistic than the "two years
of stagnation" framing suggests: many zh_TW files are only behind by
a typo fix or two.

(The ~3300 documents with no Chinese translation at all are out of
scope for both locales, so I do not think that is the problem to
solve first.)

One thing I noticed while reading the script: checktransupdate.py
tracks the base commit accurately only when the translation commit
message contains "update to commit HASH" (or "Update the translation
through commit HASH"); otherwise it falls back to guessing from author
dates. Adopting that convention for zh_TW commits from now on would
make the tool's numbers reliable, and it costs nothing. Perhaps that
could be part of the "more reasonable workflow" Weijie mentioned.

My suggestion for the first step is process/ (14 files): it is where
new contributors land first, it is small enough to finish as one
series, and it is where the terminology differences are most visible.
I would fold the pending 8.Conclusion patch into that series and build
the glossary from it.
