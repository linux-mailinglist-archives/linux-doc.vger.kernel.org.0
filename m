If it's global and we want a particular group to be watched by more
counters, I wouldn't want this to result in allocating more counters
for that group in all domains, or allocating counters in domains where
they're not needed. I want to encourage my users to avoid allocating
monitoring resources in domains where a job is not allowed to run so
there's less pressure on the counters.

In Dave's proposal it looks like global configuration means
globally-defined "named counter configurations", which works because
it's really per-domain assignment of the configurations to however
many counters the group needs in each domain.

The remaining filesystem operations will be assigning or removing
shared counter assignments in the applicable domains, which would
normally correspond to mkdir/rmdir of groups or changing their CPU
affinity. The shared assignments are more "program and forget", while
the exclusive assignment approach requires updates for every counter
(in every domain) every few seconds to cover a large number of groups.

When they want to pay extra attention to a particular group, I expect
they'll ask for exclusive counters and leave them assigned for a while
as they collect extra data.
