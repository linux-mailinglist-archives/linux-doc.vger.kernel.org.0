Ugh.  Why don't you like %PG_readahead?   I absolutely loath the
practice of hiding flags inside accessor functions, and hiding the truth
in documentation is just as bad.  It all makes grepping that much
harder.
I would MUCH prefer that the %PG_ were restored.  Please.

VFS??  The code is in mm/readahead.c, not in fs/*.c
Why didn't you like "caller" ??
