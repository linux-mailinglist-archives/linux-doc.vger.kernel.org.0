I wasn't attached to "total". I tried to change the type of the existing
"mba_MBps" option to fsparam_string_emtpy() in the hope that existing users
would be able to keep using "mba_MBps", and users who want to use total
bandwidth could use "mba_MBps=total". But that type requires the "="
in the string provided by the user for the "empty" case.

So now I'm experimenting with adding a new option:

	fsparam_string("mba_MBps_event", Opt_mba_mbps_event)

so a user would specify "mba_MBps_event=total" instead of "mba_MBps".
My code also allow for "mba_MBps_event=local" if a user want to ensure
they use the local bandwidth event (failing the mount if it is not
available).

Existing code using the legacy "mba_MBps" option will get local by
default, failing over to total if needed.

Yes. I had some justification in earlier versions, but lost it along the
way. I will include in next version.

I'd like to avoid too much feature creep in this series. I'd like to
finish solving the original problem (systems without local bandwidth
monitoring should have a way to use total bandwidth) before tackling
additional issues in a separate patch series. Taking on a simple way
for users to request total bandwidth isn't much extra code. Making
it possible to switch events at runtime isn't. Fixing the corner cases
where the feedback loop may get stuck is also a separate issue.

That does look awful. Next version will do this:

-       bool                            enable_mba_mbps;
+       bool                            enable_mba_mbps_local;
+       bool                            enable_mba_mbps_total;

Global is now gone.

But I'm not fond of this overloading the meaning of resctrl_membw.mba_sc
by making that assumption that "0" will never be a valid event.

I've left the mba_sc field as a boolean that indicates enabled and added
a new field for the event:

@@ -138,6 +139,7 @@ struct resctrl_membw {
        bool                            arch_needs_linear;

        u32                             *mb_map;
 };

New version will be posted soon.
