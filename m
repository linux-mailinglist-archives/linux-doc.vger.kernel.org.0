Not a maintainer anymore, but --

I only give out a Reviewed-by: if I can say with a straight face "I read
this code thoroughly and understand it well enough to transform / build
on top of / maintain it if need be." I'd accept one from anyone who I
thought was either really familiar with the codebase or has become their
manager's stuc^Wappointee for maintenance.

Compare that to an Acked-by, which means "I scanned this while
doomscrolling fsdevel over coffee and none of it is now in the
keyboard", which is a much lower standard.  I'd accept one from pretty
much anyone, because that just means you're in the email blasting radius
if/when things go wrong.  Even moreso if the person qualifies their ack
with a "# XXXX" to contextualize their acknowledgement.

Concretely, I might ignore an RVB from Sam Naghshineh if he showed up
claiming to be an expert on some ext4 thing, but I wouldn't drop an Ack
from Neal because then who do I pull in when boffins demonstrate that
fallocate implements a Turing machine and hence in need of a libvirt
port?

I would, however, explicitly point out that maintainers can drop or
ignore tags as they please; and that doing so may discourage future
participation by people who feel ignored.
