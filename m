Thanks for the encouragement.  At the time that I wrote that (20 July)
I did not expect to get around to it for months.  But there happens to
have been various VFS-involving works going on in mm/shmem.c recently,
targeting v6.6: which caused me to rearrange priorities, and join the
party with tmpfs user xattrs, see

https://lore.kernel.org/linux-fsdevel/e92a4d33-f97-7c84-95ad-4fed8e84608c@google.com/

Which Christian Brauner quickly put into his vfs.git (vfs.tmpfs branch):
so unless something goes horribly wrong, you can expect them in v6.6.

There's a lot that you wrote above which I have no understanding of
whatsoever (why would user xattrs stop rmdir failing?? it's okay, don't
try to educate me, I don't need to know, I'm just glad if they help you).

Though your mention of "unprivileged" does make me shiver a little:
Christian will understand the implications when I do not, but I wonder
if my effort to limit the memory usage of user xattrs to "inode space"
can be be undermined by unprivileged mounts with unlimited (or default,
that's bad enough) nr_inodes.

If so, that won't endanger the tmpfs user xattrs implementation, since
the problem would already go beyond those: can an unprivileged mount of
tmpfs allow its user to gobble up much more memory than is good for the
rest of the system?

Hugh
