Hm, I thought I saw it yesterday when I reviewed the code.  Let me look
again...

Now it does.  In the past, I think we did create some memory.  I know
when we hook debugobjects up to kobjects (there's an external patch for
that floating around somewhere), that is one reason to keep the
kobject_put() rule, and there might have been other reasons in the past
20+ years as well.

So yes, while you are correct today, the "normal" reference counted
object model patern is "after the object is initialized, it MUST only be
freed by handling its reference count."  So let's stick to that rule for
now.

If you want, I can put some code in the kobject_init() logic to force
this to be the case if it bothers you :)
