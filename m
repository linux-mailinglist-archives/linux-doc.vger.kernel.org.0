Not as is. The global has to go, and there's no use for debugfs. So we
are just left with a sprintf() around a ring_buffer. I am left in the
same position as just wanting to generalise tracek to take the ringbuffer
as a parameter.

I definitely can't make the mistake of flooding kms tracing with
overwhelming execution traces -- we can't go back to mixing kms traces
with execution traces.
