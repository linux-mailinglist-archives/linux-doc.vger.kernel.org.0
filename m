I was unclear. The mba_MBps option must remain as legacy ABI. My
"instead of" was intended to convey that a user wanting total bandwidth
would use:

# mount -t resctrl -o mba_MBps_total resctrl /sys/fs/resctrl

rather than the new option being a modifier and requiring both
the legacy option and the modifier like this:

# mount -t resctrl -o mba_MBps,mba_MBps_total resctrl /sys/fs/resctrl

which seems overly verbose.

So we defintely have:

"mba_MBps" - defaults to local, on systems without local may switch to
total if that is available. Should this switch get a pr_info()? Or just happen
silently (as I've done in patches so far).

and need to come to agreement on which of these to implement:

A) "mba_MBps_total" - forces use of total. Fails the mount if total is not
   available.

B) "mba_MBps={local|total)" forces use of chosen event, fails if event
is unavailable.

C) Something else.

D) Don't provide any way to force use of total event.
