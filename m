I know it is a rhetorical question ... nevertheless
It's a soft cap, so it depends on the number of open files usually floating 
around on the machine. It even depends on the file systems. That was actually
my motivation (more than the negative entries). Some cache entries are 
expensive for our fuse server due to our DLM usage and private data 
held in user space.

After reading your thoughts and those of the others who have taken the time
to revisit this, I think there is no better solution in the VFS layer.

Since 2025 (commit 395b95530343e) shrink_dentry_list() is an exported symbol 
and that can be used for a specific file system to do its own housekeeping. 
This will probably be considered a misuse by some , but it would be more 
specific and better controllable especially from filesystems where certain
cache entries are more expensive than others and/or running in user space (FUSE).

Thanks for the clear words. I realy appreciate it!
