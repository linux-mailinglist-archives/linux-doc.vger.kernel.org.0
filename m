Seems like it was done as part of the hysteresis that stops accepting
pages into zswap once full until it reaches a certain threshold,
commit 45190f01dd40 ("mm/zswap.c: add allocation hysteresis if pool
limit is hit"). I guess the point is that zswap will stop accepting
pages when the limit is hit anyway, so no need to synchronously shrink
it since we can't store soon anyway. More useful context for the
commit log.

I see. Just for my own understanding, it would be correct to update
them in zswap_writeback_entry(), but we choose to do it here as we
happen to hold the lock so we get the free synchronization? I think it
could be beneficial as we may see increased concurrent writeback with
this series. Probably something to call out in the commit log as well.
