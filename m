Well, if someone gives me a way to create a sphinx-buildable tree out of 
the contents of Documentation/*, I would be happy to maintain it and 
host on RTD. I think there is benefit to have a repository of just docs, 
even if it is secondary to the main repo and is auto-committed there on 
each mainline release.

I've already negotiated with RTD.org to significantly extend the build 
time, so that's not a concern.
