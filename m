Hi Angela,

FWIW, I got a public branch that has the multitouch changes at
https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/bentiss/hid/-/commits/wip/input-mt-v5

The logic in the multitouch processing is correct but it is missing a
few bits IIRC:
- suspend/resume doesn't unset/set the multitouch parameters (doesn't
seem to be an issue on my devel laptop though)
- scantime is not properly handled
- width/height is not using the same path than hid-multitouch (and
probably not reported at all)
- hid-multitouch needs to be cleaned up to use the new core changes
instead of re-doing stuffs itself

I think that you should be able to experiment your hid-haptic changes
already, and see if that is indeed easier to use than creating an API
driver.

Cheers,
Benjamin
