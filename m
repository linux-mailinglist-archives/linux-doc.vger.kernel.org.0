So much for "the following week" :) Sorry for being a bit late.

I have finally taken a deeper look at this, and I have the following
comments that I hope you can further clarify so we can land a more
precise patch.

First of all, HAVE_CMPXCHG_LOCAL is fundamentally used in two places: in
mm/vmstat.c and in lib/percpu_counter.c. In the latter it is used in the
percpu_counter_add_batch() function, which is used tree-wide. Hence,
selecting this config option has a wide effect.

As far as I can tell, both HAVE_CMPXCHG_LOCAL and HAVE_CMPXCHG_DOUBLE
could have been added in this patch series [1] by Alexandre Ghiti, but
I've been unable to tell how it was actually tested (no mentions on that
on no Tested-by either). On my side, the board I have doesn't have
neither Zacas nor the Zabha extensions so, as I mentioned on my previous
email, I have to test everything via KVM.

Having that into account, if I build the kernel with or without the
patch applied, functions like percpu_counter_add_batch() have a
different implementation, as expected (good ol' objdump -d vmlinux
=2D-disassemble=3Dpercpu_counter_add_batch confirmed as much); and from a
general outlook, the given assembly code is what I'd expect. In order to
test it, I have to say that I've relied on checking that selftests and
similar continue to pass before/after the patch. In particular, I've run
the selftests from btrfs, and they seem just fine (and toggling a
breakpoint inside of percpu_counter_add_batch() confirms that it's being
constantly called, so we are definitely calling the "new" code).

Here I'm a bit conflicted, because you mentioned that it's only used for th=
e AMD
IOMMU driver, but support on different architectures like 5284e1b4bc8a ("ar=
m64:
xchg: Implement cmpxchg_double") or f0e4b1b6e295 ("LoongArch: Add 128-bit a=
tomic
cmpxchg support") hint into other places where this is needed. In fact, for
loongarch, it's apparently needed to fix multiple tests on sched_ext. Thus,=
 I
believe that sending a patch to drop it from the kernel would be misguided.

As for RISC-V, first of all I believe that my patch should've also included=
 that
HAVE_CMPXCHG_DOUBLE can only be selected on CONFIG_64BIT. In fact, commit
f7bd2be7663c ("riscv: Implement arch_cmpxchg128() using Zacas"), which brin=
gs
support for this (again, from the same series [1]), also requires this
configuration option. That being said, this commit doesn't say how it was
tested, and there are not Tested-by either. On my end, so far I got no luck
trying the sched_ext route mentioned in the loongarch support, which is a b=
it of
a hussle in KVM with cross-compilation and the library requirements.

But as a final note, I have used hackbench on this. I have statically compi=
led
hackbench from source [2] at commit e6fb0b2c8ad1 ("rt-tests: Add AGENTS.md =
guide
for AI coding assistants") (i.e. current master). This binary has been depl=
oyed
in three iterations where the kernel was built as:

1. Before the patch.
2. With the patch (both HAVE_CMPXCHG_LOCAL and HAVE_CMPXCHG_DOUBLE selected=
).
3. With only HAVE_CMPXCHG_LOCAL selected.

Again, given that I can only test this on QEMU, this whole thing is tested =
on
virtualized environments, so take it with a grain of salt :)

In any case, I got the following results:

|        | Mainline | Both selected | Only _LOCAL selected |
|--------+----------+---------------+----------------------|
| Mean   |  50.9966 |       54.2076 |              51.6488 |
| StdDev |   0.1508 |        0.1097 |               0.7051 |

As you can see, the results on Mainline and "only _LOCAL selected" are more=
 or
less the same, but not so much whenever _DOUBLE is also selected. I figure =
that
that these instructions are not as fast as expected on my virtualized
environment.

With all of this, I'm torned on whether we should include HAVE_CMPXCHG_DOUB=
LE,
as code-wise is pretty much the same as HAVE_CMPXCHG_LOCAL, but I can also =
see
how it can be removed as I cannot properly test it. As a middle ground, may=
be we
can leave a TODO in __arch_cmpxchg128() asking to introduce HAVE_CMPXCHG_DO=
UBLE
whenever someone can actually test it and guarantee that there are no
performance penalties as I saw on my virtualized environment.

And that's enough of my rumblings :) I'd appreciate any comments on this.

Thanks,
Miquel
