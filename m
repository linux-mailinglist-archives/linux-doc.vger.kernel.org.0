I am not sure about this one. Getting the value into units per seconds will
increase the range of values by a lot, e.g., for the frequency case the step
size can range from a few Hz up to the entire supported range (hundreds of
MHz), and if you consider that one would often have the sampling_frequency
at 250 MHz... an attribute frequency_roc could have an order of 10^17 Hz/s,
and I am not sure how practical is that, although it can have a physical meaning,
like a "chirp slope".

Not really, still the only DDS. Other DDS of the same family have a similar
Digital Ramp Generator with controls over ramp limits, rates and step.

That is a bit complicated, as you can see, this part has modes that target
one DDS parameter or multiple (destinations: phase, frequency, amplitude).
Also, multiple modes can coexist, when they target different parameters/destination.
At the same time, RAM mode complicates everything because even though it targets
one specific parameter, once it is enabled influences the base mode for the
other parameters because single-tone is off. I have ordered the mode channels so
that higher index have higher priority, so that can be a bit clearer.

Right now, all the controls are provided, what might be missing is a way
to query which level of those priorities is currently active, but those levels
are not the same thing as the controls. If we turn the priority levels into the
controls themselves it would be a different ABI and it would get a lot messy.
That is why I am dumping this priority table in this document! =(

Yes, I can go for the software powerdown in that case! and the powerdown attribute
could be removed?

Partially, but the real reason is that single-tone and RAM shares the same profile
registers. So I have things cached, which allows user to change single-tone stuff
while RAM is enabled.

How about dwell_en, but it might not sound that generic. I used "enable" because:
- no-dwell high means a ramp-up pattern (only enabling the ramp-up channel)
- no-dwell low means a ramp-down pattern (only enabling the ramp-down channel)
- both no-dwell is a continuous ramp that goes up and down. (both enabled)
The last case is a bit off though, when both are disabled we get the normal mode, which
is also a ramps up and down, but dwelling in the limits.

yeah... frequency steps would make sense when the user controls when to
perform the updates, or when it comes from certain events.

sampling frequency defines the timing and this roc attr would
also depend on timing... there would be two options:
* ignore updating ramp step when sampling freq is updated. Here roc
  would have a different value when readback.
* cache the "requested" roc and use it update ramp step when sampling
  freq is updated, so roc remains with the value initially configured.

I suggested dwell_en, and I am not sure what else could be used here.
Something like hold_en could work and sounds more generic.. not sure.

No, there is only one RAM enable bit, once it is on, all single tone
profiles go away (all profile registers are repurposed for RAM mode
usage).

Can be removed, but just to point out that the configured value will adjust to the
value where the divider is an integer. Maybe the user should be aware of that.

OSK is either in manual or auto:
* In manual mode the OSK pin enables and disables the output based on its level.
* In auto, the OSK pin controls the direction the amplitude updates. 

If we enable RAM mode, and other modes do not target amplitude, the only way to
manually configure the amplitude in software (i.e. without using an OSK gpio)
is going manual mode (scale_step == 0), disable this pinctrl_en and then set the
scale property (ASF register). That is the only reason I added this property.

ok... and this one is still missing the correspondent available attr.
