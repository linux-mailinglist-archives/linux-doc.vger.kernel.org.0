To clarify: Atomic assumes that the sw state always matches hw state, even
at boot-up. Most drivers use drm_mode_config_reset to achieve that, which
forces everything to off. But that breaks flicker-free boot.

To avoid that i915 (and it's the only driver doing so) has fairly
elaborate state-readout code, to make sure we do faithfully preserve the
full boot-up display state. This is anything but trivial to implement.

For simpledrm it's a bit simple, since state recover boils down to reading
out the fb and putting it into the new one, since there's not even
provisions (afaiui) for simpledrm to enable/disable the output physically.

So i915 is the exception here allowing flicker-free boot, not the rule.
