Thanks, this was a good reminder that I very much needed to look back at
the memory cgroup limiting of xattrs on tmpfs - I'd had the patch in the
original series, then was alarmed to find shmem_alloc_inode() using
GFP_KERNEL, so there seemed no point in accounting the xattrs if the
inodes were not being accounted: so dropped it temporarily.  I had
forgotten that SLAB_ACCOUNT on the kmem_cache ensures that accounting.

"tmpfs,xattr: GFP_KERNEL_ACCOUNT for simple xattrs" just sent to fix it:
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-fsdevel/f6953e5a-4183-8314-38f2-40be60998615@=

Thanks,
