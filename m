From: Alexander Potapenko <glider@google.com>

This adds the Kernel Electric-Fence (KFENCE) infrastructure. KFENCE is a
low-overhead sampling-based memory safety error detector of heap
use-after-free, invalid-free, and out-of-bounds access errors.

KFENCE is designed to be enabled in production kernels, and has near
zero performance overhead. Compared to KASAN, KFENCE trades performance
for precision. The main motivation behind KFENCE's design, is that with
enough total uptime KFENCE will detect bugs in code paths not typically
exercised by non-production test workloads. One way to quickly achieve a
large enough total uptime is when the tool is deployed across a large
fleet of machines.

KFENCE objects each reside on a dedicated page, at either the left or
right page boundaries. The pages to the left and right of the object
page are "guard pages", whose attributes are changed to a protected
state, and cause page faults on any attempted access to them. Such page
faults are then intercepted by KFENCE, which handles the fault
gracefully by reporting a memory access error. To detect out-of-bounds
writes to memory within the object's page itself, KFENCE also uses
pattern-based redzones. The following figure illustrates the page
layout:

  ---+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+---
     | xxxxxxxxx | O :       | xxxxxxxxx |       : O | xxxxxxxxx |
     | xxxxxxxxx | B :       | xxxxxxxxx |       : B | xxxxxxxxx |
     | x GUARD x | J : RED-  | x GUARD x | RED-  : J | x GUARD x |
     | xxxxxxxxx | E :  ZONE | xxxxxxxxx |  ZONE : E | xxxxxxxxx |
     | xxxxxxxxx | C :       | xxxxxxxxx |       : C | xxxxxxxxx |
     | xxxxxxxxx | T :       | xxxxxxxxx |       : T | xxxxxxxxx |
  ---+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+---

Guarded allocations are set up based on a sample interval (can be set
via kfence.sample_interval). After expiration of the sample interval, a
guarded allocation from the KFENCE object pool is returned to the main
allocator (SLAB or SLUB). At this point, the timer is reset, and the
next allocation is set up after the expiration of the interval.

To enable/disable a KFENCE allocation through the main allocator's
fast-path without overhead, KFENCE relies on static branches via the
static keys infrastructure. The static branch is toggled to redirect the
allocation to KFENCE. To date, we have verified by running synthetic
benchmarks (sysbench I/O workloads) that a kernel compiled with KFENCE
is performance-neutral compared to the non-KFENCE baseline.

For more details, see Documentation/dev-tools/kfence.rst (added later in
the series).
