Maybe it's time to add one?

Neither covers all use cases. As you noted in your mempolicy message, if the
application wants finer grained control, cgroup interface isn't great. In
general, any changes which are dynamically initiated by the application
itself isn't a great fit for cgroup.

I'm generally pretty awry of adding non-resource group configuration
interface especially when they don't have counter part in the regular
per-process/thread API for a few reasons:

1. The reason why people try to add those through cgroup somtimes is because
   it seems easier to add those new features through cgroup, which may be
   true to some degree, but shortcuts often aren't very conducive to long
   term maintainability.

2. As noted above, just having cgroup often excludes a signficant portion of
   use cases. Not all systems enable cgroups and programatic accesses from
   target processes / threads are coarse-grained and can be really awakward.

3. Cgroup can be convenient when group config change is necessary. However,
   we really don't want to keep adding kernel interface just for changing
   configs for a group of threads. For config changes which aren't high
   frequency, userspace iterating the member processes and applying the
   changes if possible is usually good enough which usually involves looping
   until no new process is found. If the looping is problematic, cgroup
   freezer can be used to atomically stop all member threads to provide
   atomicity too.

Thanks.
