Way back when PSI_MEM_FULL was accounted from the timer tick, task
switching could simply iterate next and prev to the common ancestor to
update TSK_ONCPU and be done.

Then memstall ticks were replaced with checking curr->in_memstall
directly in psi_group_change(). That meant that now if the task switch
was between a memstall and a !memstall task, we had to iterate through
the common ancestors at least ONCE to fix up their state_masks.

We added the identical_state filter to make sure the common ancestor
elimination was skipped in that case. It seems that was always a
little too eager, because it caused us to walk the common ancestors
*twice* instead of the required once: the iteration for next could
have stopped at the common ancestor; prev could have updated TSK_ONCPU
up to the common ancestor, then finish to the root without changing
any flags, just to get the new curr->in_memstall into the state_masks.

This patch recognizes this and makes it so that we walk to the root
exactly once if state_mask needs updating, which is simply catching up
on a missed optimization that could have been done in commit 7fae6c8171d2
("psi: Use ONCPU state tracking machinery to detect reclaim") directly.

Apart from this, it's also necessary for the next patch "sched/psi: remove
NR_ONCPU task accounting". Suppose we walk the common ancestors twice:

(1) psi_group_change(.clear = 0, .set = TSK_ONCPU)
(2) psi_group_change(.clear = TSK_ONCPU, .set = 0)

We previously used tasks[NR_ONCPU] to record TSK_ONCPU, tasks[NR_ONCPU]++
in (1) then tasks[NR_ONCPU]-- in (2), so tasks[NR_ONCPU] still be correct.

The next patch change to use one bit in state mask to record TSK_ONCPU,
PSI_ONCPU bit will be set in (1), but then be cleared in (2), which cause
the psi_group_cpu has task running on CPU but without PSI_ONCPU bit set!

With this patch, we will never walk the common ancestors twice, so won't
have above problem.
