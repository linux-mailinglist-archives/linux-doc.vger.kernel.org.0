Subject: [PATCH RFC] Make the docs build "work" with Sphinx 3.x
Message-ID: <20200904102925.52fcd2a1@lwn.net>
Organization: LWN.net
MIME-Version: 1.0

The Sphinx 3.x upgrade broke a number of things in our special "cdomain"
module that are not easy to fix.  For now, just disable that module for the
3.x build and put out a warning that the build will not be perfect.  The
problems affect primarily the media documentation where :name: is used.

This is not a great solution, but it at least allows the docs build to
proceed on systems running 3.x until somebody has the time to put together
a proper fix.

It seems that much of what we have in cdomain.cpy isn't needed with 3.x,
though that has to be verified.  But the :name: extension is problematic.
That needs a hard look, it's guaranteed to be a hard thing to maintain
going forward and it would be nice if we could find a way to do without it.

Meanwhile, building the docs with Sphinx 3.2.1 takes nearly twice as long
as with 2.2.2.  Given that the process was not exactly fast before, this
is not a welcome change.  Sigh.
