I still don't think the origin story is useful.  It's trivia and doesn't
help someone understand what they need to know.

This makes it sound like virtual addresses are only used for
instructions.  I had better wording earlier, but there's no point in
repeating it.  Just: I dissent.

The word "target" isn't adding any value in this paragraph.

Honestly, I don't like much about this document.  The writing is
flabby and untargetted.  Much of my last review was ignored.  I'm just
going to stop here since I have low confidence that any suggestions
would be incorporated.
