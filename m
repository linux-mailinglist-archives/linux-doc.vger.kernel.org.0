The irqdomain documentaion became obsolete over time. Update and extend
it a bit with respect to the current code and HW.

Most notably the doubled documentation of irq_domain (from .rst and .h)
was unified and let only in .rst. A reference link was added to .h.

Furthermore:
* Some 'struct' keywords added, so that the respective structs are
  hyperlinked.
* :c:member: used where appropriate to mark a member of a struct.
* Some wording rephrased to improve readability/understanding.

 irq_domain Usage
 ================
 
-An interrupt controller driver creates and registers an irq_domain by
-calling one of the irq_domain_add_*_of_node() or
-irq_domain_add_*_fwnode() functions (each mapping method has a
-different allocator function, more on that later).  The function will
-return a pointer to the irq_domain on success. The caller must provide
-the allocator function with an irq_domain_ops structure.
+struct irq_domain could be defined as an irq domain controller. That
+is, it handles the mapping between hardware and virtual interrupt
+numbers for a given interrupt domain. The domain structure is
+generally created by the PIC code for a given PIC instance (though a
+domain can cover more than one PIC if they have a flat number model).
+It is the domain callbacks that are responsible for setting the
+irq_chip on a given irq_desc after it has been mapped.
+
+The host code and data structures use a fwnode_handle pointer to
+identify the domain. In some cases, and in order to preserve source
+code compatibility, this fwnode pointer is "upgraded" to a DT
+device_node. For those firmware infrastructures that do not provide a
+unique identifier for an interrupt controller, the irq_domain code
+offers a fwnode allocator.

 In most cases, the irq_domain will begin empty without any mappings
 between hwirq and IRQ numbers.  Mappings are added to the irq_domain
 by calling irq_create_mapping() which accepts the irq_domain and a
