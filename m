right, also considering that we will (I hope) have the rtsl next, and other
ideas coming around the usage of osnoise: events on other tracers, I also think
should a more generic term to the events. Indeed, on rtsl they have a different
name.

Thinking only about the instrumentation/events, what they are tracking is the
execution time. So how about naming them as:

exec_time:thread
exec_time:irq

Also adding that, although here we measure the execution time of "task" context,
on rtsl we have other kinds of "windows" that they measure, for instance, the
poid window (Preemption or IRQ disabled). So, the term exec time also fits there.

?
