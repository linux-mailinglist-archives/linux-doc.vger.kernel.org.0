Yes. It is lazy state from provider implementation. If hardware requires
you to power down and set mode, it could have been handled internally in
the driver. I think we should fix these providers.

Lets document that call order is immaterial and driver is expected to
work both ways? As I said earlier logically people would set things up
and power up, and on the fly mode changes can be handled internally in
the driver by doing off-set-on dance.

Thinking out loud, we can also move this into framework and ensure when
modes are set, we do off-set-on dance so that onus on providers is
removed. Moving into fwk might expose some bugs in drivers though...

One thing I agree is that we should have consistency. How we drive that
can be agreed upon.

Thanks
