There are a few aspects that I don't agree with in this RFC, and I think
Nhat and Johannes raised most of them. Mostly that I don't want to
expose ghost swapfiles or similar to userspace.

I think userspace's view of swapfiles should remain the same and reflect
the physical swap slots. The virtual swap layer should be completely
transparent in this case. Userspace shouldn't need to configure it in
any way.

In an ideal world, the only noticeable change from userspace is that
with zswap, compressed pages would stop using slots in the swapfile and
charging the memcg for them -- and that zswap would work even without a
swapfile, by just enabling it. This is admittedly a user-visible
behavioral change, but I am hoping that's a good one that we can live
with.

If there are real concerns about this, we can discuss things like a knob
or config option to keep charging zswap pages as swap slots (ew..) or
only allow zswap with a real swapfile (double ew..). But I am really
hoping we can get away with changing the semantics without doing this.

We can add extra interfaces for virtual swap as needed, e.g. virtual
swapoff that you mentioned to clear the swap cache, or stats about the
virtual swap space (which translates to memory overhead).

There are also a few missing pieces like different memcg charging, but
these were already pointed out, and we can figure them out as we go.

Nhat/Johannes, WDYT? Am I missing somthing?

Yeah I saw that (but didn't really have time to do anything else about
it). Splitting this out is definitely the right thing to do, and the
series looks great from a very high level. Awesome work, as usual :)
