You're right that if usermode had taken the bitmask aspect to heart,
they might try to ask for cpus that were SLOW | EMULATED, and expect
to get the set of both. None of the other combinations make sense, so
I think this is the only one worth worrying about. That case is super
broken today as they'd get SLOW | EMULATED | FAST (basically all CPUs
always). We have no way to distinguish whether they actually passed
SLOW | EMULATED or FAST. I'm tempted to not worry about this case and
assume anyone who passed 3 meant FAST, but you're right it's there.

Specifying CPUPERF_0 as a bitmask was a mistake (mine) in the
documentation that got translated to code when the WHICH_CPUS flag was
introduced and hwprobe_key_is_bitmask() showed up. It was always
supposed to be an enum, with EMULATED being a (significant) step worse
than SLOW.

My expectation is that most software will just ask "which cpus are
FAST" and nothing else. It's not easy to write software that somehow
takes advantage of the difference between EMULATED and SLOW, though it
is nice to know for reporting/telemetry purposes.

Agreed, it makes sense to me to have HWPROBE_MISALIGNED_* be the only
value in CPUPERF_0, and add a new CPUPERF_1 key for true bitmap
features. I currently don't have any bits to stuff into the newly
proposed key, but when they do I agree it makes sense to put them in a
new key.
