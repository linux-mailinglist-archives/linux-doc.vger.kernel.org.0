Maybe it is just me, but placing doc files in the crowd together with code
on a project where documentation has its own directory sounds weird(*).

(*) except for userspace tools and staging drivers where we want
    everything, including documentation, contained on a single place.

What several subsystems do - for instance the media subsystem - is to
place the maintainer's profile at the driver api, like this:

	Documentation/driver-api/media/maintainer-entry-profile.rst

And adding it to Documentation/driver-api/<subsystem>/index.rst.

This way, subsystem developers will see it together with all other
the developer-specific documentation.

As you're already using some scripting to do a bidirectional sync,
you could add there some logic to convert rust pin-init documentation
to rst and place it at Documentation/rust/.

This is just my 2 cents.

-

Btw, on a quick check, only Rust has markdown files:

	$ git ls-files|grep ".md$"|grep -v tools/
	rust/pin-init/CONTRIBUTING.md
	rust/pin-init/README.md
	rust/proc-macro2/README.md
	rust/quote/README.md
	rust/syn/README.md

As one of the people who spent years helping improving the Kernel
documentation and doing lots of conversions from markdown
and other non-structured text formats to RST, I have to say that I'm
concerned with any trends that would add doc files that aren't
properly integrated with the Kernel documentation system like those.
