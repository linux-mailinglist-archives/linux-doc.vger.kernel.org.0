We've had this particular discussion before.  My own feeling is that
translated documentation can make an easier entry point for developers
who did not grow up speaking English; that, in turn, makes our community
just a little bit more inclusive.  We certainly can't *require* any sort
of translation work, but I'm happy to encourage it where the interest
exists.

Thanks,
