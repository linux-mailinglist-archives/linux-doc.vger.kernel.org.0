Hi Greg, Thomas,

Just thinking, wouldn't it be useful to strongly encourage that the
document should be in plain text format ? Otherwise the door remains open
for sending you a self-extractable EXE file which contains an encrypted
Word doc, which is not the most useful to handle especially to copy-paste
mitigation code nor to comment on. Even some occasional PDFs we've seen
on the sec@k.o list were sometimes quite detailed but less convenient
than the vast majority of plain text ones, particularly when it comes
to quoting some parts.

Just my two cents,
Willy
