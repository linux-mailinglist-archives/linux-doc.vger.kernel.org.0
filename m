That scaling is indeed a bit of a pain though it will go in a 64 bit int
however, seems likely we'll get higher frequency devices one day that will
limb even faster.

Maybe wait and see if anyone else has input on this.

There are two in staging that have been there a very long time... 
ad9832 and ad9834.  I haven't looked at how they correspond to this.

We should think hard about whether to bring them inline with this
and out of staging, or just delete them.

I understand (at least some) of the hardware complexity but I don't like
the fact this is effectively exposing it to userspace. + I really don't want
more ABI to indicate whether a mode is actively doing anything or not.
Whilst I agree the code will be more complex, having clarity on what is
enabled at any given time is definitely something we ant to aim for.

Can we work out a transition diagram?  That might make it easier to
tell whether it's possible to map it as single enables at a time and
incorporate weird corners like the RAM one.  Maybe not needed if the
RAM one is the only real oddity and otherwise it's just going up
and down the priority lists.

One complexity I can see with single enables is that they'd need
to be separate for each of frequency, phase and amplitude to reflect
the transitions that can occur.

Also the fun of profiles, where those profile pins are basically picking
symbols - could be used for multi level PSK or FSK for example if wired
up to an external symbol source.  I'd be a bit surprised if those are
always wired up to a host CPU.

*sigh* I'm talking my self around to needing ABI to indicate a channel
is active.  The symbol stuff gets us some of the way there (and would
work for the tones) but doesn't cover the added complexity of RAM etc.
So 'maybe' new ABI for _isactive or something like that?

Perhaps the boundary we put on this is the ABI should be such that
simple choices such as enabling a single tone, or single RAM mode
setting are intuitive. 

Why do we only have one ram channel? I'd kind of expect the firmware
to fill all 8 RAM profiles because of that 'external' profile pins
use case.

Yes, I think that works.  If all sources are disabled, then powerdown.
Maybe we keep the powerdown as well though as that's standard DAC ABI.

Ah. So there is no smooth (e.g. race free) path to transition from RAM mode to
single tone? That is annoying.

Looking at this again, how do we set the DRG mode?  E.g. if it effects
only phase?

You've lost me here.  How can they do that?  Some external clocking
or event?

If we do end up going the roc route both are valid ABI, but the second is
nicer from useability point of view.

I'd missed the repurposing that basically means you never transition from
tone to RAM without going via some intermediate point (maybe power down).

If you keep it just add something to note that it takes discrete values
according to that formula.  I was reading more into it than that and
getting confused to where step_rate was coming from!

Ah.  Maybe we hide that away and make the amplitude a property of RAM channel?
It can do this magic under the hood. I don't mind the attributes for OSK changing
if this trick is in use (they won't be active anyway).

Available is a bit tricky when there is an inverse relationship involved in the maths
as what do we put the step as.  Maybe we should add a note on that to the ABI
docs.  [min step max] where step gives the minimum step that due to non linearity
may not be applicable between discrete values that may be taken away from that
minimum granularity base value.  If that occurs the driver will round to the
nearest possible value.

Something like that.
