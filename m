No idea! It seems that the text editor I used on that time added
it for whatever reason.

The cdrom doc is a very special case: it was originally written in LaTeX.
I don't remember any other document in LaTeX inside the Kernel docs during
the conversions I made. See:
	e327cfcb2542 ("docs: cdrom-standard.tex: convert from LaTeX to ReST")

In order to convert it to .rst, I used some tool to first turn it
into plain text (probably LaTeX, but I don't remember anymore), and then
I manually reviewed the entire file, adding ReST tags where needed.

I didn't realize that utf-8 chars were used instead of normal ASCII chars,
as both appear the same when editing it[1].

[1] I use Fedora here. Fedora changed the default charset to utf-8 a long
    time ago.

Anyway, we should be able of get rid of weird UTF-8 chars from it with:

	$ iconv -f utf-8 -t ascii//TRANSLIT Documentation/cdrom/cdrom-standard.rst

I'll prepare a patch fixing it. Some care should be taken, however, as
it has two places where UTF-8 chars should be used[2].

[2] There are two German person names that use UTF-8 chars:
    - 'o' + umlat;
    - a LATIN SMALL LETTER SHARP S (Eszett)

Thanks,
Mauro
