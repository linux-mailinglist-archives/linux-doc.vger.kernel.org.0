I agree that is a problem with trying to make generic anything. But it
does not mean you should not even try. Maybe trying really hard saves a
couple revisions.

What I think should be planned for is revisions. How to add new
properties that do the same thing but better, while documenting that a
userspace KMS client can use only one revision at a time. You never
remove old revisions, unless maybe with a DRM client cap they
could disappear from that file description if that is necessary for
seeing the new revision.

While designing this, one also needs to take into account that KMS
clients need to be able to save and restore properties *they do not
understand*. So exposing two revisions of the same feature
simultaneously would break save/restore is that's an error.

But you can't move, you can only add? You can't delete the old property
in kernel if it was ever released with a kernel and anyone used it. In
the same sentence you also imply that there is a user of it, so
removing it will break that user. Then you'll have to track the
userspace lifetime to figure out which decade you can try removing it.

You have to carry the backward compatibility in all cases, right?

Userspace OTOH can drop support for older less supported KMS properties
while taking advantage of a new revision. Userspace is not required to
support old kernels forever.


Here's a wild counter-proposal off a tangent:

How about we make "implemented in and testable with VKMS" the rule,
instead of "is generic" for new properties?

VKMS is what compositors (will) use in CI. I would feel hugely less bad
about using a property that only one hardware driver ever implements,
if also VKMS implements it in a way that compositor CI can observe it
working.

I don't expect this proposal to be accepted, but it's food for thought.
The major problem for compositor projects is testing as you usually
don't have the hardware, IMO. CI tends to not have any hardware.
