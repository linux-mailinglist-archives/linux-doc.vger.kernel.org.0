The change was generated by running
Documentation/features/scripts/features-refresh.sh
Sorry, I should have mentioned this in the commit message. I noticed the
updated features for powerpc after updating the RISC-V supported
features [1].

[1] https://lore.kernel.org/linux-riscv/20200810095000.32092-1-tklauser@distanz.ch/T/#u

AFAIK, the features-refresh.sh script has no way of distinguishing
between different types of an architecture. It just checks for the
respective Kconfig symbols listed in the
Documentation/features/**/arch-support.txt files in all arch/**/Kconfig
files and updates the feature to "ok" if it finds the Kconfig symbol.
