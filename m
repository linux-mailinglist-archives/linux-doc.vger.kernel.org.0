Sorry, I missed the detail.  So, the description should be updated to:

    This patchset introduces an implementation of DAMON's low level primitives
    for physical addressspace of _mapped_ LRU pages.

Well, I didn't intended the use case...  I just wanted to let people see the
data accesses on physical address space without tracking every mappings of the
pages.

Anyway, ok, we could consider supporting unmapped pages, but I'm unsure why and
how much it is necessary.  After all, who could access unmapped pages?  Could
you give me more details on the needs for access monitoring of the unmapped
pages?


Thanks,
