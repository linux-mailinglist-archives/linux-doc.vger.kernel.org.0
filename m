"submitting-patches.rst" does not answer "how to submit a patch ?".
70% of the material is about how a patch should look like and how
to react once you have submitted a patch.
The most important tool for *submitting* a patch (git send-email)
is missing completely (only mentioned in a side note).

If you want to get "submitting-patches.rst" shorter, move the material, 
which does not deal with "how to submit a patch", to somewhere else.

It means *YOU* are able to work with the machine comfortably
( == you are able to use git, you are able to edit the source code,
you are able to compile the kernel, ...)
This probably will not be the case for a 10 year old computer running a 2.6 kernel.
But this is subjective; hence why I wrote "not too old" (== not too old for YOU).

That's exactly the same kind of configuration I need when setting up 
any other E-Mail client without using a wizard.
"submitting-patches.rst" assumes that you are able to setup your E-Mail client.

"git send-email" needs less configuration than setting up a regular E-Mail client,
because the configuration for receiving Mail is not needed.

This is *NOT* a tutorial.
The text I wrote is trying to answer the question "how to submit a patch ?".
I expect readers to be able to type
  git configure e-mail address
into Google.

As contrast: Right now if I type
  linux kernel submit patch
into Google I get "submitting-patches.rst" as first hit;
and I get no information at all that "git send-email" is 
the right tool to submit a patch.

Because this is a local git repository.
The whole point in using git is to be able to save
intermediate steps (via "git commit").
You have to cleanup the code modifications before you *publish* them;
but not while you are creating them.

Because this is a local git repository.
I expect to have a few iterations, before I am satisfied with the modification.
I do not want to put a sign-off on each local iteration, because that's a waste of time.
I add the sign-off once I am ready to publish (via "git format-patch").

E-Mail programs tend to garble E-Mails (which is already mentioned
in "submitting-patches.rst").
If you want to make sure, that the ASCII content is completely 
unmodified, the only way to find out if that works is to send 
an E-Mail to yourself and inspect it.

That's also why I think "git send-email" is the only reliable
approach to submit a patch; all the other well-known E-Mail programs
are painful, if you want to make sure the ASCII content is not touched
(maybe "mutt" is one of the few exceptions).
If you are behind a corporate SMTP server, then I guess the SMTP server 
itself might STILL modify your E-Mail :-(
(like adding a mandatory "signature"...)

"git send-email" knows how to translate the output
of "git format-patch" into an E-Mail.

In "submitting-patches.rst" it says:
  proper patch formatting can be had with git format-patch

This is misleading.
For sure you *should not* paste or attach the output of 
"git format-patch" into your E-Mail program verbatim.


so long
