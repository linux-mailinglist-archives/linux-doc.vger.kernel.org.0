Are you looking for something specific to RISC-V general or perf on RISC-V?
All the RISC-V PMU patches have been upstream for a while (both in the
Qemu & Linux kernel).
Perf should work out-of-the box when you boot the latest kernel in the
latest version of the Qemu.

Initial KVM[1] patches support got merged during the last merge
window. It doesn't support
event sampling yet. We are working on that.

I did not see any arch specific information there. Let us know what
would be good to
add there and we would be happy to add.
