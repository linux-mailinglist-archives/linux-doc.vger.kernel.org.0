So maybe part of the confusion is that this sentence 
can be read permissively, depending how the 'where 
possible' qualifier is interpreted:

    Please send plain text emails without attachments, 
    where possible.

Note how "it's not possible because my report is in 
PDF" seems to allow for that in the permissive reading.

What that sentence should really say is something like:

   Please send plain text emails only. Please do not 
   include any attachments, where possible.

This makes it clear that only plain text emails are 
acceptable.

Ie. something like the patch below?

Thanks,

	Ingo
