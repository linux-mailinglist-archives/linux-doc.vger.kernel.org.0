Agreed, but this is not really a problem with Sphinx but with
Python itself: you can't include any module that has "-" on it, or
doesn't end with ".py"[1].

[1] I guess it is actually possible, but only using low-level APIs,
    e.g. using importlib.util, importlib.util.module_from_spec(spec)
    and other dirty tricks, but this is certainly something we should
    avoid to do.

Just saw it ;-)

I don't like it either, but Python is really picky on some things.

The problem here is that this is a Python policy violation. To change
that, one needs to write a PEP and convince Python maintainers to merge
it, together with changes on python "import" directive.

Alternatively, assuming that some magic words would be enough to
convince importlib to load a name without ".py" and with "-", it could be
easier to convince Sphinx autodoc maintainers to take a patch, as they're 
probably using importlib somewhere to dynamically import a file based 
at the string inside "automodule" directive. On a quick grep,
this seems to be the case, and such logic is inside:

	sphinx/ext/autodoc/importer.py

It may be true for kernel-doc, but:

- there are other scripts that we may want to document; and:
- we need to define a naming convention for python code

Also,

- keeping it in separate makes harder to maintain.

So, even if we don't actually add kernel-doc docstrings and
functions via autodoc, I think it is still worth having a
name convention that would allow that.

Thanks,
Mauro
