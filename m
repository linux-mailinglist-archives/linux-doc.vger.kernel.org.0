Well, I don't know what to describe other than the subject, the rest is
in the patch. :)

Landlock works well with overlayfs, at least from my point of view. It
may be a bit disturbing with bind mount though, but it is the same with
other access-controls (e.g. DAC). Landlock users should just think about
file hierarchies and create their policies accordingly. A user should
not try to adapt a policy according to his/her understanding of
overlayfs, but just think about file hierarchies.

/proc can be blocked, but not /proc/*/ns/* because of disconnected
roots. I plan to address this.

It was first an implementation constraint to limit the memory allocated
for each rule, but it could now be increased if needed. The
implementation still uses u64 for the sake of simplicity, but we could
switch to a bitmap type.
