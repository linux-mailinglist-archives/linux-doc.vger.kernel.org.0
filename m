Yes at the protocol layer I take care to lookup all of this states at
init so that the initial states are consistent with what exposed...

Yes it is currently world readable and only root has write access by default,
BUT in this latest V4 I added (as asked by some internal team) handling of the
usual uid/gid/umask mount options so that a privileged user can change the ownership
policy at mount time. (not supporting anyway FS_USERNS_MOUNT since it does not
make sense to support containers for SCMI Telemetry)

No, I dont think so...the only planned extensions were to support more
performant read access mechanisms, i.e. direct mmap'ability of FW/Kernel
SCMI Telemetry shared memory areas...BUT that will immediately dump all
the bulk of the lower layer protocol work into the tools domain...and
we're not ready to do so...beside having one more thing, the tool, to keep
in sync with possible future spec changes (unless exposing even more stuff
like tlm mem-areas accessors to the UAPI...that would be painful kernel
side and not desired AFAIU...)

I suppose depends on your usage pattern: it is definitely relevant
because the main collection mechanism are shared memory areas (SHMTIs)
between the platform firmware and the Kernel: such areas being accessed
from 2 differnt worlds concurrently come with a SCMI-specified
synchro/consistency mechanism based simply on a pair of sequence numbers
placed at the start and at the end of the SHMTI, so that the FW increases
such magic numbers in a well-known way before and after updating the SHMTI
values, so that the kernel can detect (without any interlocking mechanism)
if a platform write happened in the middle of its reads...

...so if you read one single DE 64bit value, under the hood the kernel
would have had to really perform at leats 3 reads from the SHMTI to check
the consistecy of that single read...

... while if you do a bulk_read the overhead due to the consistecy
checks gets 'spread' across a number of DEs because the kernel will snapshot
the whole SHMTIs (potentially KBytes) between the 2 consistency reads

...the good side effect of all of this is that I can leverage such
sequence number to optimize reads..i.e. do NOT even try to read anything
if the new sequnce number is unchanged from the last one I cached on the
last successfull read of this value...

So at the end I would say it is NOT simply a nice to have BUT it is
certainly only the first step towards a more performant alternative access
(like with mmaps)...it depends on the usage pattern...I am not sure what
mechanism is used by our tools more...

I have to sync with tools on this...because they are stiil probably
using currently the FS, but it was already planned for the future to move to
a more low level access (ioctl/mmap)...

...my aim would be, at this point, to favour this transition without sudden
breaking their current world (and have to expatriate :P)

..from my personal point of view, I would certainly like to still have the
FUSE layer for ease of testing and verification on my side...but it is just
a nice to have...

Yes concurrent reading is not a problem, and concurrent writes are
properly handled at the write/message level (i.e. no corruption) BUT
no co-ordination is provided from the kernel on those config writes,
last write wins.

Mmm...not sure what you mean here...

If you configure your Telemetry as you desire and start collecting data via
readers, BUT then some other process changes configs under your belt, that is
allowed as said, and so your analisys could be impacted...(something turned off
as an example, or update interval changed)...

...so while this is NOT regulated/co-ordinated by the Kernel, in order to
ease the detection of such events by your reading process, I provide a pollable
entry that returns an integer and then blocks until such counter is next updated
by an intervening under-the-hood configuration change...so you can configure,
monitor the generatin counter and then starts reading you data, sure that you
will detect any conflicting re-config issued by a rougue process...
(and I have to still extend this event polling mechanism to use a user
provided eventfd...since it was NOT strictly needed...but now with
IOCTLs interface I will add that too...)
