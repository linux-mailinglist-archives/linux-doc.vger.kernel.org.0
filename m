Ah great, so we have no unclear challenge (additional loadable module support
and conflicts with other IBS modules) on our road for now!  That is, we can
reuse the stable perf event interface and achieve all our goals!  As I
previously shared [1], it would take time, but I'm very optimistic about the
success of this project.  I don't like promising too much, but this project
looks like something that we can "consider it done".

We can also say that the current candidate of the first
damon_report_access()-based data attributes monitoring (milestone 2 [1] final
deliverable) is the perf event based monitoring.

FYI, and as you may already know, the current plan [1] is to use the attributes
probe interface.  With it, the above IBS Op event setup part would look like,

mon_attr=/sys/kernel/mm/damon/admin/kdamonds/0/contexts/0/monitoring_attrs
echo 1 > $mon_attr/probes/nr_probes
probe=$mon_attr/probes/0
echo 1 > $probe/filters/nr_filters
filter=$probe/filters/0
echo perf_event > $filter/type
echo ibs_op > $filter/perf_event_type
echo Y > $filter/allow

Of course, more details could change later.

Thank you so much for sharing the great prototype implementation and test
results!

I will try to make fast progress on milestone 1.  I will hold reviewing details
of this series for now, as there could be more changes.  But in the high level,
this looks promising.
