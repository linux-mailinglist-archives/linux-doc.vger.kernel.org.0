Hmm, there may be more issues lurking here:

https://lore.kernel.org/all/20200929140226.GB53442@C02TD0UTHF1T.local/
https://lore.kernel.org/all/20200929142411.GC53442@C02TD0UTHF1T.local/

... and I'm guessing if we assign a fixed virtual address range it'll
live outside the linear mapping, which is likely to break certain
requirements of kmalloc()'d allocations in certain situations (a
problem we had with v1 of KFENCE on arm64).

So I don't even know if that's feasible. :-/

Thanks,
