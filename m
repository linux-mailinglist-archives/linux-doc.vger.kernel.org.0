Yeah I think we should track it in software if possible to completely
avoid the poison scenario you describe above. Relying on setting a
reasonable limit and a certain compression ratio doesn't sound too
comforting.

Makes sense.

I just want to point out that using compressed memory with zswap doesn't
buy us much in terms of reclaim latency, so the main goal here is just
saving memory on the top tier, not improving performance, right?

Yeah it's counter-intuitive. Zswap needs to charge less than PAGE_SIZE
so that memcg tracking continues to make sense with reclaim (i.e. usage
goes down), but if zswap consumed a full page from the system
perspective, the math won't math.

Separate limits *could* be the answer, but it's harder to configure and
existing configuration won't "just work" with compressed memory.
