Thanks Yu!

Yes, I was interested due to container use-cases.

Now a few thoughts in this direction:
- With swap per cgroup you loose the big "statistical" benefit of
having swap on a node level. well, it depends on the size of the
cgroup (i.e. system.slice is quite large).
- With todays node level swap, and setting memory.swap.max=3D0 for all
cgroups allows you toachieve a similar behavior (only opt-in cgroups
will get swap).
- the above approach however will still have a shared swap backend for
all cgroups.
