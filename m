Thanks for this series. This is a problem I have come across and am looking

This makes sense, but the quota is also considered when setting the minimum
allowable score in damos_adjust_quota(), which, to my understanding, assumes
that all of the all of a region's data will by applied. If an action fails for
a significant amount of the memory, a lower score than what was calculated in
damos_adjust_quota() could be valid. If that's the case, the scheme would be
applied to fewer regions than strictly necessary.

As you mention above, this is not a correctness issue because the quota only
guarantees an upper limit on the amount of data the scheme is applied to.
Additionally, it may very well be true that what I listed above would not be
very noticeable in practice. I just thought this was worth pointing out as
something to think about.

Thanks,
Bijan
