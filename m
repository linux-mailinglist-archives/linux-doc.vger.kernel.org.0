If we are getting extra data to userspace, then either we aren't creating the
SPI message correctly and telling the controller to read too much data or
the HDL is broken.

If single-channel parts currently don't work and two-channel parts need [1] or
a hardware descrambler to work with a single data line, then it sounds like we
are blocked here until the HDL is improved or [1] is merged.
