Appreciate all the comments.

Jassi,

I understood you have talked with some of our folks (Trilok and Carl) a
few years ago about using the mailbox APIs. We were steered away from
using mailboxes then. Is that still the recommendation today?

Doorbells will be harder to fit into mailbox API framework.

  - Simple doorbells don't have any TX done acknowledgement model at
    the doorbell layer (see bullet 1 from 
https://lore.kernel.org/all/68e241fd-16f0-96b4-eab8-369628292e03@quicinc.com/).
    Doorbell clients might have a doorbell acknowledgement flow, but the
    only client I have for doorbells doesn't. IRQFDs would send an
    empty message to the mailbox and immediately do a client-triggered
    TX_DONE.

  - Using mailboxes for the more advanced use-case doorbell forces client
    to use doorbells a certain way because each channel could be a bit on
    the bitmask, or the client could have complete control of the entire
    bitmask. I think implementing the mailbox API would force the
    otherwise-generic doorbell code to make that decision for clients.

Further, I wanted to highlight one other challenge with fitting Gunyah
message queues into mailbox API:

  - Message queues track a flag which indicates whether there is space
    available in the queue. The flag is returned on msgq_send. When the
    message queue is full, an interrupt is raised when there is more
    space available. This could be used as a TX_DONE indicator, but
    mailbox framework's API prevents us from doing mbox_chan_txdone
    inside the send_data channel op.

I think this might be solvable by adding a new txdone mechanism.

Some notes about fitting mailboxes into Gunyah IPC:

  - A single mailbox controller can't cover all the gunyah devices. The
    number of gunyah devices is not fixed and varies per VM launched.
    Mailbox controller would need to be per-VM or per-device, where each
    channel represents a capability.

  - The other device types (like vCPU) don't fit into message-based
    style framework. I'd like to have a consistent way of binding a
    device's function with the device. If we use mailbox API, some
    devices will use mailbox and others will use some other mechanism.
    I'd prefer to consistently use "some other mechanism" throughout.

  - TX and RX message queues are independent and "combining" a TX and RX
    message queue happens at client layer by the client requesting access
    to two otherwise unassociated message queues. A mailbox channel would
    either be associated with a TX message queue capability or an RX
    message queue capability. This isn't a major hurdle per se, but it
    decreases how cleanly we can use the mailbox APIs IMO.
      - A VM might only have a TX message queue and no RX message queue,
        or vice versa. We won't be able to require coupling a TX and RX
        message queue for the mailbox.

  - TX done acknowledgement doesn't fit Gunyah IPC (see above) and a new
    TX_DONE mode would need to be implemented.

  - Need to make it possible for a client to binding a mailbox channel
    without DT.

I'm getting a bit apprehensive about the tweaks needed to make mailbox
framework usable for Gunyah. Will there be enough code re-use and help
with abstracting the direct-to-Gunyah APIs? IMO, there isn't, but
opinions are welcome :)

Thanks,
Elliot
