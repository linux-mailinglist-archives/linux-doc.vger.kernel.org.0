Yeah, I'm also planning to address at least some of the issues you
pointed, in order to improve the html output, but got sidetracked by something 
else and didn't find any time yet to finish. I'm adding some CI automation for
the media subsystem in order to help us dealing with the huge amount of patches
we receive there.

Feel free to add those details to the changelog. I may find some spare time 
this week or the next one for the improvements you suggested, but those 
could be sent on followup patches, once done.

Thanks,
Mauro
