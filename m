Since Jim is busy with other work and I'm working on some things that
rely on this, I've taken up the task of doing the iterations.  I've
addressed the comments as best I can (those replies are to each
individual change) and here is the patch set to go with those.

I added my own signoff to each commit, but I've left jshargo@ as the
author of all the commits he wrote.  I'm sure there is still more to
address and the ICT tests that were writtein parallel to this may also
need some additions, but I'm hoping we're in a good enough state to get
this in and iterate from there soon.

Since V4:
========
Fixed up some documentation as suggested by Marius
Fixed up some bad locking as suggested by Marius
Small fixes here and there (most have email responses to previous chain
emails)

Since V3:
========
I've added hotplug support in the latest patch.  This has been reviewed some
and the notes from that review are addressed here as well.

Relevant/Utilizing work:
=======================
I've built a while test framework based on this as proof it functions (though
I'm sure there may be lingering bugs!).  You can check that out on
crrev.com if you are interested and need to get started yourself (but be
aware of any licensing that may differ from the kernel itself!  Make
sure you understand the license:

https://source.chromium.org/chromiumos/chromiumos/codesearch/+/main:src/platform/tast-tests/LICENSE

That said, you can see the changes in review on the crrev gerrit:

https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromiumos/platform/tast-tests/+/4666669

Outro:
=====
I really appreciate everyone's input and tolerance in getting these
changes in.  Jim's first patch series was this, and other than some
small cleanups and documentation, taking over it is also mine.

Thank you everyone :)
