Yeah, it should be "Limits". I will update the text.

This is a very trivial controller. I believe once it becomes public it
can be helpful down the line to the v1 users, who cannot use v2 yet, for
some simple resource accounting, like us, we have the need for ASIDs
accounting in v1 until we move to v2. If the community has strong
objection then I can remove v1 support.

Limit and counter are kind of suggesting the underlying technique for
accounting instead of a generic name to denote resource types managed by
this controller. One can argue that if top level names are similar to
Resource Destribution Model then may be it makes sense to combine
resources with similar accounting technique under one controller.

I am looking at misc as a controller which is for resources not having
proper home in other controllers or not big enough to deserve their own
controller.

I agree with you coming up with a name which check all boxes of
requirements won't be possible. We have discussed name sev cgroup,
kvm cgroup, encryption_id cgroup before reaching to an agreement on misc
cgroup. I am open to other names if they are better suited for this
controller and makes more sense.

Thanks
Vipin
