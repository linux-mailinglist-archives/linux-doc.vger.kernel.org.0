Let me clearer what I had in mind, avoiding the PANIC_ON terminology
John raised. I was wondering if it would make sense to

1) Be able to specify a severity for WARN (developer decision)

2) Be able to specify a severity for panic_on_warn (admin decision)

Distributions with kdump could keep a mode whereby severe warnings
(e.g., former BUG_ON) would properly kdump+reboot and harmless warnings
(e.g., clean recovery path) would WARN once + continue.

I agree that whether to panic should in most cases be a decision of the
admin, not the developer.


Now, that's a different discussion then the documentation update at
hand, and I primary wanted to raise awareness for the kdump people, and
ask them if a stronger move towards WARN_ON_ONCE will affect
them/customer expectations.

I'll work with John to document the current rules to reflect everything
you said here.
