Thanks for trying this approach!

For the format part, PHYS don't need that much bits I think,
so by slightly adjust the format vswap device could be share
mostly the same format with ordinary device.

For example typical modern system don't have a address space larger
than 52 bit. (Even with full 64 bits used for addressing, shift it
by 12 we get 52). Plus 5 for type, you get 57, so you can have a
marker that should work as long as it shorter than 1000000 for PHYS,
and shared for all table format since it's not in conflict with
anything. You have also use a few extra bits so a single swap space
can be 8 times larger than RAM space, and since we can help
multiple swap type I think that should be far than enough?

Then you have Shadow back at 001, and zero bit in shadow. The only
special one is Zswap, which will be 100 now, and that's exactly the
reserved pointer format in current swap table format, on seeing
si->flags & VSWAP && is_pointer(swp_tb) you know that's zswap :)

Folio / PFN can still be 010 as in the current swap table format.

Then everything seems clean and aligned, no more special handling
for vswap needed, there are detailed to sort out, but it should work.

Or reuse the PHYS format (rename it maybe) since point back to vswap
is also pointing to a si.

This could be imporved by per-si percpu cluster. Both YoungJun's
tiering and Baoquan's previous swap ops mentioned this is needed,
and now vswap also need that. If the vswap is also a si, then it will
make use of this too.

YoungJun posted this a few month before:
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-mm/20260131125454.3187546-5-youngjun.park@lge.com/

The concern is that some locking contention could be heavier, or maybe
that's just a hypothetical problem though.

I checked the code and I think it's not hard to do, patch 1 already
handling the meta data dynamically, everything will still just work
even if you remove vswap at runtime. The rest of patches need adaption
but might not end up being complex, it other comments here
are considered.

For patch 2, a few routines like vswap_can_swapin_thp seems not
needed or should be moved to __swap_cache_alloc? VSWAP_FOLIO is
same as swap cache folio check, which is already covered. Same for
zero checking, and VSWAP_NONE which is same as swap count check
I think. That way we not only save a lot of code, we also no
longer need to treat vswap specially.

If you keep the format compatible with what we already have
as the earlier comment mentions, a large portion of this part
might be unneeded.

I also noticed the new introduced swap_read_folio_phys in patch 3, so
this actually can be done using Baoquan's swapops idea which is now
part of Christoph's swap batching:

https://lore.kernel.org/linux-mm/20260528124559.2566481-9-hch@lst.de/#r

That series is focusing on batching and better performance but swapops
was also proposed as a way to solve the virtual layer, makes it possible
to have vswap as one kind of swapops which is Chris talked a lot about:

https://lore.kernel.org/linux-mm/aZiFvzlBJiYBUDre@MiWiFi-R3L-srv/

Following this, we could have something like:

const struct swap_ops swap_vswap_ops = {
	.submit_write		= swap_vswap_submit_write,
	.submit_read		= swap_vswap_submit_read,
};

The move the folio_realloc_swap in swap_vswap_submit_write.

Merge of IO might be moved to lower phyiscal level for vswap.

Another gain is that the memory usage and CPU overhead will be
lower with only one layer. As I'm recently trying to offload swap
dataplane off CPU so the CPU won't touch the data at all, the
overhead will be purely by swap itself, plus some mm overhead.
Things like that and IO optimization above and could make swap
subsystem more and more performance sensitive so we have cases
that needs only one layer.

Zero map is not really a problem when it's just a inlined bit I think.
For memcg table allocation, on demand seems a good idea, and actually
we are not far from there, I tried to generalize the
alloc-then-retry-sleep-alloc in swap_alloc_table but still not generic
enough I guess.. Good new is the allocation of the table is already
kind of ondemand, just need to split the detection of these two kind
of table.

Mean while I also remember we once discussed about splitting the
accounting for vswap / physical swap? If we went that approach we
don't need to treat memcg_table specially.

This should be very easy to do, just replace unsigned int with
unsigned long, a lot of place to touch though :)
