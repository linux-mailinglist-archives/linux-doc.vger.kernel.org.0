+KSM has the possibility of memory side channel attacks. When individual
+VMA's have KSM enabled, the security aspect needs to be considered.
+
+An individual workload doesn't know what else is running on
+the machine, so it needs to be highly conservative about what it can
+give up for system-wide merging.
+
+However, if the system is dedicated to running multiple jobs within the
+same security domain, there is a usecase where multiple instances of the
+same job are running inside a safe shared security domain and using the
+same sensitive data.
