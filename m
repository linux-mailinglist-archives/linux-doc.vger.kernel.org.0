So I've applied this (and the integer power functions one too), but let me
grumble for just a moment...

This patch adds a set of new warnings to the docs build:

> +./lib/string_helpers.c:236: WARNING: Unexpected indentation.
> +./lib/string_helpers.c:241: WARNING: Block quote ends without a blank line; unexpected unindent.

It would be *really* nice if folks would check for these things and fix
them when they arise.  The docs build is a horrific mess of warnings that
will never get better if we keep adding more.  This one is an easy fix;
I'll toss together a patch to do it.

Beyond that (and this is in no way your fault, I'm just whining)
kernel-api.rst has become a huge dumping ground.  Someday it would sure be
nice if we could create a bit more order there...

Thanks,

jon
