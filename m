I don't agree with this. I have found clear written rules valuable
personally when discussing with management. Being able to point to
upstream policies and tell "this is not allowed" helped change internal
processes. It will obviously not have a 100% success rate, but it's not
useless.

We don't seem to live in the same (perfect or imperfect) world. In my
experience, contributions from external kernel developers are often
better than patches originating from within a company. External
contributors are more used to follow proper upstream review processes.
