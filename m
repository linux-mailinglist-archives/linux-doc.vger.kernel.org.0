Interesting. When I give a Reviewed-by: to a patch, I am most definitely
letting it be merged into other trees. For anything I pull in, I don't add
a Reviewed-by and will strip any tag that says I did review it as my
Signed-off-by includes that I reviewed the patch.

The difference I give between Acked-by and Reviewed-by is that my Acked-by
is "I don't see anything wrong with the idea of the change, and it can go
via another tree", where as a Reviewed-by is "I took time to understand the
change itself, and have not found anything wrong with it".

Basically, an Acked-by is "I took a quick look, and I'm OK with it, but if
it breaks something of mine, I expect you to fix it." and Reviewed-by is "I
took a deeper look, and if it breaks something of mine, I hold myself at
fault, and will fix it myself". ;-)
