So ... here are a few "make htmldocs" builds that I ran

  VERSION  BUILD TIME
  2.4.3     5:24
  4.1.2    10:51
  4.5.0    10:57
  5.0.1    11:17

So 5.0 has actually regressed from 4.5 in terms of speed, and takes more
than twice the time that 2.4.3 takes.  These slow builds are really
painful when I'm working through the docs patch queue and have to build
things frequently; they are also a disincentive for other developers to
build the docs and make sure they haven't broken anything.

(Interestingly, total CPU time is ~16:45 for 2.4.3, and ~21:45 for the
later versions.  So latter-day Sphinx does use more CPU, but it also
seems to have lost some parallelism.)

I hope you understand why that makes me reluctant to move the minimum
version up to 3.0.  But, looking further at this conversation, I don't
think we need to at this point.  You said:

Having looked through the all-too-numerous warnings emitted by our docs
build, I don't see any that look like they would be tied to pre-v3
C-domain syntax.  I *believe* that you could remove that support and it
wouldn't bother us, unless there's something I'm missing?

I truly appreciate your contacting us about this - thanks!
