I am fine with that. I will do that in a subsequent revision once we
figure out the column limit issue.

Okay, so this is interesting. When I look at the applied patches in my
local repo, I don't see any 81+ lines. So it seems that something
interesting is going on here.

To be clear (sorry for the stupid question) you are seeing the issue
after you applied the patch, and not in the patch file itself?

Since we are still at OSS, would you mind if we meet up this afternoon
so I can see this issue you are seeing? I imagine we should get this
figured out pretty quickly.

Cheers
