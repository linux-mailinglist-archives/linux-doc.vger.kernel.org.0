In a perf session has multiple events, and events have different branch
filters, seems to me, a simple way is to return error for this case.

I would argue BRBE is an IP for recording branches per CPU wise, it does
not support recording for event wise.  If we can unify branch filter
within a perf session, would this be much easier for handling?

Seems to me, the problem is not caused by event rotation.  We need to
calculate a correct filter in the first place - the BRBE driver should
calculate a superset for all filters of events for a session.  Then,
generate branch record based event's specific filter.

If we save BRBE record when a process is switched out and then restore
the record when a process is switched in, should we can keep a decent
branch record for performance profiling?

I understand it might be many things happen in the middle of a task
switching or migration, but it is fine for not recording branches during
the blackout period.  The missed branch records are not very helpful for
forming a flow for a profiled program itself, especially, if we
consider we will optimize userspace program in many cases.

I agreed that event rotation case might be rare and complex.  Please see

Here I am really concerned are cases when a process is preempted or
migrated.  The driver doesn't save and restore branch records for these
cases, it just invalidates all records when a task is scheduled in.

As a result, if an event overflow is close to context switch, it is
likely to capture incomplete branch records.  For a userspace-only
tracing, it is risk to capture empty branch record after preemption
and migrations.
