Okay, so the initial value of some parameters might not be "disabled" etc.

I guess, from a user space perspective, reading should be allowed by everyone
but writing should be limited to root?

Do you assume that there will get significantly more config options added in the
future for user space to configure?

Is this bulk-reading relevant for performance or just a "nice to have" ?

Yes. How high-priority is the fs side? Or would a tool using a library to access
this information also work in the first step?

Yes.

Good.

Would concurrent reading work? I assume so, right?

Okay, so a single writer (admin) changing stuff could get picked up my possibly
many concurrent readers?

Yes, thank you a lot, I hope it also helps Christian to help push this into the
right direction!
