The problem is related to the indentation of "value given".

With ReST, this causes the first line to be print in bold.

The reason for that is that a common practice to describe
arguments on texts is to use this:

	foo
		Does foo things
	bar
		Does bar things

Without this feature at ReST, the above would need to be:

	**foo**

	Does foo things

	**bar**

	Does bar things

Which is more polluted with symbols, on text mode.

-

Just changing the kernel-doc markup at kernel/futex.c:

	/**
	 * futex_setup_timer - set up the sleeping hrtimer.
	 * @time:	ptr to the given timeout value
	 * @timeout:	the hrtimer_sleeper structure to be set up
	 * @flags:	futex flags
	 * @range_ns:	optional range in ns
	 *
	 * Return: Initialized hrtimer_sleeper structure or NULL if no timeout
	 *	   value given
	 */

To:

...
	 * Return:
	 *
	 * Initialized hrtimer_sleeper structure or NULL if no timeout
	 * value given 
	 */

Should fix it.

We can't make kernel-doc ignore alignments, as otherwise other
things will break, as several kernel-doc markups use indents
for some things (like supporting literal-blocks).

So, such kind of fixes need to be done at the kernel-doc markups.

In this very specific case, though, I guess, some regex could
be used to convert things like:

	* Foo: some multiline
	*      description

into something like:

	* Foo:
	*
	*      some multiline
	*      description

or:

	* Foo:
	*
	* some multiline
	* description

kernel-doc uses this regex to match "Return":

	my $doc_sect = $doc_com .
	    '\s*(\@[.\w]+|\@\.\.\.|description|context|returns?|notes?|examples?)\s*:(.*)';

I guess something could be added after this:

    if (/$doc_sect/i) { # case insensitive for supported section names
        $newsection = $1;
        $newcontents = $2;


in order do to the replacement. Maybe something like this (untested):

    if (/$doc_sect/i) { # case insensitive for supported section names
        $newsection = $1;
        $newcontents = $2;

	my $spaces = $newsection;
	$spaces =~ s/\S/ /;

	$newcontents = $spaces . $newcontents;

Would do the trick.

Thanks,
Mauro
