The honest answer is that I don't know. I used to think that the
distinction is as you described - after someone done the initial triage
on the patch it goes New -> Under review.

But there's little consistency with that happening and it's unclear what
"initial triage" constitutes at this stage, so for all practical
purposes New =3D=3D Under review.

This indicates that netdev maintainers are waiting for someone who
is not a netdev maintainer. Let me s/maintainer/expert/ to make that
clearer-ish.
