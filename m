Hi, sorry about the long delay, been off the grid a bit.

I doubt I would have urged you to try Hawkmoth for kernel documentation
specifically, but rather more, uh, regular C projects, but I'll take
your word for it if you say so. ;D

Bug reports are always welcome at

The main difference between kernel-doc and Hawkmoth is that the latter
does not try to parse the documentation comment at all, apart from
removing the comment markers. It's expected to be pure rst, and it's fed
to Sphinx as-is. What I'm saying is that what the output ends up being
is not in the control of Hawkmoth, it's between the rst and Sphinx.

With Hawkmoth, it's whatever Sphinx and doctools generate from pure rst
field lists.

Ditto. kernel-doc does not use field lists.

kernel-doc generates that information, while Hawkmoth sticks to pure
rst.

Hmm, I think it should be similar to the parameters. See e.g.

That's indeed a bit odd.

An alternative to using a bulleted list for different return values is
to use a separate :return: field list item for each.

For example,

 * :return: 1 if @page is a regular filesystem backed page cache page or a lazily
 *   freed anonymous page (e.g. via MADV_FREE).
 * :return: 0 if @page is a normal anonymous page, a tmpfs page or otherwise ram or
 *   swap backed page.

Obviously in this case you'd need to figure out where to put the first,
common sentence, so might not be so nice here.

BR,
Jani.
