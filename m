Yeah, anyone can do that.

But when there is any bug you want to ask for help from community, can
you share your use case? Or is it easy for you to do so? At that time,
you still need to figure out how to trigger it in one open source
implementation, then share the use case. Otherwise, not sure if
community can help you easily.

There will be more functions or features added to ublksrv/ublk driver, it
really needs one open source project to verify/test. You may say the
feature is verified in your private/closed source environment, but
usually not good, cause no one can reproduce it.

The max buffer bytes is defined in ublksrv_ctrl_dev_info, and that is
max length of any incoming io request.

I explained it in last email, this way won't waste memory, and needn't extra
swap out too.

It is just for existing project.

Any new project can read the data from the pre-allocated buffer
directly. That is exactly the handling flow: ublksrv gets one request from
ublk driver, then let backend handle the request.

Can you explain why backend can't use the pre-allocated buffer directly? Before
backend completes the io request, the io request and buffer won't be reused, that
is owned by this tag/slot.

That is definitely inefficient, and I won't encourage any new project to
use this command.

ublksrv just needs to write data to the buffer, then send the buffer
with UBLK_IO_COMMIT_AND_FETCH_REQ to driver, and driver will copy the
data to request's pages.

Why does the userspace need to know when the copy happens?

Yeah, that is why it is completely safe since the future request can
only come _after_ ublk driver has copied the previous buffer to request
pages.

Not sure I get your point, but in short UBLK_IO_NEED_GET_DATA is only
for legacy uses.
