I think the assumption you and Daniel are making is that the first implementation of
a new KMS property can be made standard from day one and that it will work for any
late comer driver as is, without having to make changes to its behaviour in a
significant way. In my experience that is not the case.

I think we have moved from the times when we were trying to implement in the Linux
world features that were available in the hardware but needed a kernel and userspace
API. The set of properties that exist in KMS cover a lot of needed functionality and
I don't expect to see new properties for stuff that is already supported by hardware.

What I'm expected to see in the future is new functionality that gets implemented by
one hardware vendor and the kernel developers trying to enable that for userspace. It
could be that the new property is generic, but there is no way of testing that on
more than one implementation yet, so I'd say we are generous calling it "standard
property". When the second or third hardware vendor comes along and starts supporting
that property with their own set of extra requirements, then we can call it
"standard". Then comes the effort cost: would it be easier to start with a vendor
property that only the vendor needs to support (and can submit patches into the
compositors to do so) and when the standard property gets added moves to that, or
should we start with a generic property that gets implemented by the compositors
(maybe, but then only one vendor supports it) and then later when we actually
standardise the property we will have to carry backwards compatibility code in the
kernel to handle the old behaviour for old userspace? My proposal to Maxime was for
the former option to be reflected in the documentation, but I would like to hear your
thoughts.

Best regards,
Liviu
