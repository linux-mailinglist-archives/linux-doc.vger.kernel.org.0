I'd like to emphasize even more strongly that it is applied by the
maintainer or committer, and should reference the patch that got
applied. And that the patch submitters shouldn't try to add it
themselves. (Which makes you wonder about the placement in
submitting-patches.rst.) IMO other references should use References:
that is already widely used.

The above would also match current usage in e.g. the drm subsystem.
