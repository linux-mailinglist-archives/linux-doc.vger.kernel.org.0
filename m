In fact that's what I tried first and it was super long with many short
lines, making it possibly worse. But maybe aggregating several short
entries on a line by similarities could work, I can give it a try.

My fear if we redirect to other files is that it won't be read again.
However, we could possibly suggest to always look for the subsystem's
specific rules in this subsytem's doc, leaving enough freedom to
maintainers to reject more things.

Indeed I didn't list IB (I'm never sure about it, I seem to remember
we simply trust any peer, is that right?), nor did I make specific
mentions for USB which is implicitly covered by "hardware emulation
or modification".

thanks!
