It should be (per CPU [*]). The queue itself is a linked list, and if we
have requests on the queue we don't let new requests skip the queue.

[*] and if you have packets coming through multiple CPUs at the same
    time, ordering won't be predictable anyway

Sure. And for iperf3/TCP tests, I'm seeing much better performance out
of async crypto (or much lower CPU utilization for the same throughput
on UDP tests), even with the FPU busy. I decided to go the sysctl
route instead of reverting because I couldn't figure out how to
reproduce the problems you've hit, but I didn't want to just bring
them back for your setup.

macsec doesn't use CRYPTO_TFM_REQ_MAY_BACKLOG.

If we get more packets than we can process, we drop them. I think
that's fine.

It maintains the ordering of requests. If there are async requests
currently waiting to be processed, we don't let requests bypass the
queue until we've drained it.

To make sure, I ran some tests with numbered messages and a patched
kernel that forces queueing decryption every couple of requests, and I
didn't see any reordering.
