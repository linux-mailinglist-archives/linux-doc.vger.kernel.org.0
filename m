More updates on it:

It seems that the main issue is that Sphinx passes Documentation/foo
to docutils, when SPHINXDIRS=foo is used, and docutils prevent
access anything outside Documentation/foo on its include and toctree
directives.

So, even trying to use "../ABI/some_doc" would fail.

-

The other issue is that SphinxParallelError doesn't stop the
build multithreading tasks. As Documentation/docutils.conf is set to 
abort on severe errors, this causes Sphinx to keep running forever,
doing nothing.

I did already a workaround to prevent media Jenkins job to hang
due to those issues. So, I'm moving on. Hopefully, someone with
more experience with Sphinx, docutils and python multithreading
can work on some fixes for it.

Thanks,
Mauro
