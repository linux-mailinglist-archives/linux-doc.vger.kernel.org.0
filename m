I took a closer look at all the patches. Everyone of them is a bug fix
except Patch 4/6. But Patch 4/6 is a fairly minimal change and I think
it's easier/cleaner to just pick it up too instead of trying to
resolve merge conflicts in the stable branch.

1/6 - Fixes what appears to be a memory leak bug in upstream.
2/6 - Fixes error in initial state of the device link if it's created
under some circumstances.
3/6 - Fixes a ref count bug in upstream. Looks like it can lead to memory leaks?
4/6 - Adds a minor feature to kick off a probe attempt of a consumer
5/6 - Fixes the break in functionality that happened in 4.19.99
6/6 - Fixes bug in 5/6 (upstream bug)

Greg

Do these patches look okay for you to pull into 4.19 stable? If so,
please let me know if you need me to send v2 with commit fix up.

The only fix up needed is to these patches at this point is changing
"(cherry picked from commit ...)" with "[ Upstream commit ... ]". The
SHAs themselves are the correct SHAs from upstream.

Thanks,
Saravana
