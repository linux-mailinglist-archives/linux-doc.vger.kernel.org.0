Subject: [PATCH] Documentation/CodingStyle: Fix duplicate "are" typo
Date:   Mon,  1 Jun 2020 12:00:49 +0200
Message-Id: <20200601100049.32240-1-geert@linux-m68k.org>
X-Mailer: git-send-email 2.17.1
Sender: linux-doc-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-doc.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-doc@vger.kernel.org

The improved paragraph about line lengths contains a sentence with a
duplicate word: there is one "are" at the end of a line, followed by a
second one at the beginning of the next line.

Drop the first one, as that one is part of the longest line.

Fixes: bdc48fa11e46f867 ("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning")

Perhaps we should aim for no line length limit at all, to make such
typos easier to catch? ;-)
