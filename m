Thanks for forwarding this question to him and to address it on distros!

Nice! Yeah, this is the long term solution, but still won't prevent
people/distros based on older packages to keep using packages
without such requirements.

Yeah, Fedora is usually keen to changes.

Yes. RHEL/EPEL is usually a lot more conservative.

On both Tumbleweed and on Leap?

Debian package maintainer could reconsider it after the upstream
dependency addition, but probably only for SID and yet-to-be-released
versions. Debian is very conservative on their releases. 
Even if SID gains such dependency fix, I would be surprised 
if they end porting a dependency change like that to Bullseye
(which should be the latest version for ~1.5 years - with LTS
extending it for ~3.5 years).

It sounds worth mentioning about the texlive dependency decision at
the Debian bug.
