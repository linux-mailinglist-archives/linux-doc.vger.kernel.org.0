And that's the crux of the problem. From kernel POV I'd very much prefer
not setting an upper bound for the Sphinx version. I think it's
important to be able to build the documentation using the latest Sphinx,
and gradually iron out the inevitable quirks that arise.

However, if you decide to drop support for pre v3 syntax in Sphinx v6,
and we decide to stick to being able to use pre v3 Sphinx, we can't move
forward to newer versions until we bump the lower bound for the Sphinx
version to v3+. (Or we need to hack around Sphinx version differences in
kernel, but I think that would be best avoided.)

BR,
Jani.
