Maybe there's something weird with your PAM settings and/or /etc/nsswitch.c=
onf. I
saw some issues in the past related to kerberos/ldap/radius/sso timeouts.

Agreed. I guess that just checking "if not slot" should be enough for such
purpose.

If you can still reproduce the original issue, I would try that and
see if it works, e.g. this should likely be enough:

                    slot =3D os.read(self.reader, 8)
                    if not slot:
                        # Stop at the end of the jobserver queue.
                        break =20
=09
