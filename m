Understood. I consciously separated the cache implementation (patch 4)
from the core metrics (patch 3) because the cache is ONE possible approach =
to
handle detection lag - not necessarily THE approach. My goal was to share
what was needed to achieve equilibrium with my synthetic benchmark
workload (multiload),
while making it clear that the cache mechanism could be dropped or
replaced with alternatives.

Sounds good. Please go ahead and incorporate the goal_tuner fix into
your series.
Happy to test whatever approach you come up with for the esz=3D0 issue.

That's a fair point. I chose TEMPORAL because I wanted to move the required
amount of pages as quickly as possible to reach equilibrium.
For my multiload benchmark with uniformly hot memory, this seemed like the
most direct approach to test the metrics.

I'm glad this observation is useful. It was something I discovered during
testing that wasn't obvious until I looked at the trace data closely.

This is a valid point. Real-world workloads with mixed hot/cold memory and
dynamic access patterns might behave differently from my synthetic benchmar=
k
where all memory is uniformly hot. The uniform-hot case is essentially a
worst-case scenario that forces continuous oscillation regardless of
detection lag compensation.

For my multiload workload without patch 4, there was significant unnecessar=
y
page movement due to the detection lag. However, as you note, that may be a=
n
artifact of the synthetic benchmark + TEMPORAL tuner combination rather tha=
n
a fundamental problem that affects all use cases.

I agree. Let's drop patch 4 for now and focus on getting the core
metrics merged.
The cache mechanism can be revisited later if real-world usage shows
it's needed.
