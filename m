Well, honestly I don't think it *really* makes a difference.
Either the message is read, understood, and compatible with
the rules in place, or it is not. As you know, we're getting
regular reports as a password-protected ZIP and stuff like
this, and it's not changing because people follow the rules
in place. However those who quickly glance at the text above
might have been believing that markdown and HTML were plain
text. With the extra addition it clarifies this specific
point, and since most returning submitters try to improve on
their second submission after our feedback I think it will
help us deliver this "feedback" prior to their first message.

I have nothing against it but I'm not convinced at all that
it brings any extra benefit over the first one. I'm fine with
both in fact.

Thanks,
Willy
