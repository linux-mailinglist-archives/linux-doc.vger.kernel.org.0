I think this function can go away in the next version.

I added this so that the PCI core could prevent userspace from
retrieving the preserved file associated with the device from LUO if
the device is not in a singleton IOMMU group (see next patch). But per
the discussion with Yi I am going to move that check to probe time.

liveupdate_incoming is used by VFIO in patch 10:

  https://lore.kernel.org/kvm/20260323235817.1960573-11-dmatlack@google.com/

Fundamentally, I think drivers will need to know that the device they
are dealing with was preserved across the Live Update so they can react
accordingly and this is how they know. This feels like an appropriate
responsibility to delegate to the PCI core since it can be common across
all PCI devices, rather than requiring drivers to store their own state
about which devices were preserved. I suspect PCI core will also use
liveupdate_incoming in the future (e.g. to avoid assigning new BARs) as
we implement more of the device preservation.

And in case you are also wondering about liveupdate_outgoing, I forsee
that being used for things like skipping disabling bus mastering in
pci_device_shutdown().

I think it would be a good idea to try to split this patch up, so there
is more breathing room to explain this context in the commit messages.

For the forseeable future, device preservation will be triggered by
userspace preserving a VFIO device file in a LUO session using the ioctl
LIVEUPDATE_SESSION_PRESERVE_FD.  After kexec, userspace retrieves the
preserved file with the ioctl LIVEUPDATE_SESSION_RETRIEVE_FD.

This section would probably make more sense if it talked about VFIO
specifically instead of abstract "files" since that is the currently the
only use-case.

I expect non-VFIO drivers (i.e. "in-kernel") drivers could be supported
eventually but they will likely need a different API.

I will add a section explaining FLB to the kerneldoc above.

"Don't bother" was the intent.

Yes that is correct.

This is not userspace triggerable unless there is a bug in LUO and/or
the driver (VFIO). By the way, that is the case for all of the WARN_ONs
in this commit. They are no userspace-triggerable, they are just there
to catch "this should never happen, there must be a kernel bug" type
issues.

I see that a lot of your comments are about these WARN_ONs so do you
have any general guidance on how I should be handling them?

No not even that would cause this warning to fire because
pci_liveupdate_unpreserve() bails immediately if liveupdate_outgoing
isn't true. This truly should never happen, hence the WARN.

For "this should really never happen" warnings, which is the case here,
my preference is to use WARN_ON_ONCE() since you only need to see it
happen once to know there is a bug somewhere, and logging every time can
lead to overwhelmingly interleaved logs if it happens too many times.

This is another "this should really never happen" check. I could just
return without warning but this is a sign that something is very wrong
somewhere in the kernel and it is trivial to just add WARN_ON_ONCE() so
that it gets flagged in dmesg. In my experience that can be very helpful
to track down logic bugs during developemt and rare race conditions at
scale in production environments.

ONCE because this is a sign of a kernel bug and one instance is enough
to warrant debugging and fixing. Allowing multiple could lead to logs
interleaving, log rotation, and other issues if there is an excessive
amount.

I also chose full WARN_ON_ONCE() over just a warning log line so that
the user gets a backtrace and can see the caller.

I agree that showing the PCI device and driver would be helpful so
pci_WARN_ONCE() would be better.

Yes

This can only be triggered by a kernel bug.

I'll switch to pci_WARN_ONCE().

Yes, PCI is just the users of File-Lifecycle Bound (FLB) data to
preserve state across Live Update.

Will do.

Good idea, will do!

pci_liveupdate_flb_get_incoming() fetches the preserved pci_ser struct
from LUO (the struct that the previous kernel allocated and populated).
If pci_liveupdate_flb_get_incoming() returns an error, it means there
was no struct pci_ser preserved by the previous kernel (or at least not
that the current kernel is compatible with), so we return 0 here to
indicate that 0 devices were preserved.

I think this is explained by my reply to the previous comment.  If
pci_liveupdate_flb_get_incoming() returns an error then there was no
pci_ser struct passed to use by the previous kernel. Thus we return.

include/linux/kho/abi/ contains all of the structs, enums, etc. that are
handed off between kernels during a Live Update. If almost anything
changes in this directory, it breaks our ability to upgrade/downgrade
via Live Update. That's why it's split off into its own directory.

include/linux/ is not part of the Live Update ABI. Changes to those
headers to not affect our ability to upgrade/downgrade via Live Update.

Yes I agree, but that is outside the scope of this patchset I think.
This directory already exists.
