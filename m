I have not been able to give the fs-verify or dm-verity patches the
same level of scrutiny as the associated subsystem maintainers simply
because I lack the deep history and background; I rely on the
associated maintainers to catch the important "gotchas" as we've seen
in the patchset.

Once again, that is what I have been doing in my effort to get this to
a point where it can be merged and sent to Linus.  I've spent numerous
hours reviewing patches on-list (and catching quite a few issues), and
working with Fan off-list, to ensure these patches continue to
improve.  I'm asking you to review the fs-verity patch(es) for two
main reasons: 1) to identify any fs-verity interaction problems, 2) as
a courtesy since you are the fs-verity maintainer and I want you to be
aware of this and accepting of the code being introduced in the
subsystem you are responsible for maintaining.

I agree.  I appreciate your help in reviewing this patchset, and those
that came before it.  I've seen Fan voice his appreciation too
on-list.

>  I just hope you can understand that I'm also a bit burnt out now,

I can understand that, and I'm sympathetic.  I've been doing this long
enough to have gone through my own cycles of burnout and rejuvenation
and I know how disheartening it can be at times.

I firmly believe that no one writes perfect code, and no one performs
a perfect review.  As far as I'm concerned, the important bit is that
you respond, learn, and strive to do better next time.
