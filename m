"xxx``at``" makes the `` appear verbatim in the HTML output. I've opted
for changing this into ``*at()`` to harmonise this with the use of * seen
later in the same document (and add the parentheses to clarify that this
is a system/function call).

``path_``* also makes `` appear in the HTML output, but we can fix it by
moving the * into the ``. Also add the parantheses here.

 It is tempting to describe the second kind as starting with a
 component, but that isn't always accurate: a pathname can lack both
 slashes and components, it can be empty, in other words.  This is
