I agree there could be a better name.

And thank you for the suggestion!

But... I don't think "by_score" is much better, because all tuners are assumed
to, and actually do the tuning of the quota based on the score.  Or, maybe you
mean it makes non-zero quota only until the score becomes the goal?  That makes
sense, but again, in a sense, that's same for "consistent" tuner.

Naming is difficult...

I was also thinking about a few more names, but my conclusion after the self
discussion was that some of ambitious names are inevitable here.  Otherwise,
the name will be too long.  I therefore picked the shortest and simplest ones
on my list, which at least contrasts the current two tuners.  I agree that
could still be difficult to understand.  But as long as there is a good
documentation, I think difficult-to-understnd names that encourage users to
read the document is ok and might even be better in some cases.

I'm of course open to other suggestions.


Thanks,
SJ
