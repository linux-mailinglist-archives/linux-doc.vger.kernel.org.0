Gah, sorry, typo.  The API doesn't tell *KVM* that userfault exit is due to an
async #PF.

Heh, it's a generic "problem" for faults in general.  E.g. modern x86 CPUs will
take "spurious" page faults on write accesses if a PTE is writable in memory but
the CPU has a read-only mapping cached in its TLB.

It's all a matter of cost.  E.g. pre-Nehalem Intel CPUs didn't take such spurious
read-only faults as they would re-walk the in-memory page tables, but that ended
up being a net negative because the cost of re-walking for all read-only faults
outweighed the benefits of avoiding spurious faults in the unlikely scenario the
fault had already been fixed.

For a spurious async #PF + IRQ, the cost could be signficant, e.g. due to causing
unwanted context switches in the guest, in addition to the raw overhead of the
faults, interrupts, and exits.

When it comes to uAPI, I want to try and avoid statements along the lines of
"IF 'x' holds true, then 'y' SHOULDN'T be a problem".  If this didn't impact uAPI,
I wouldn't care as much, i.e. I'd be much more willing iterate as needed.

I'm not saying we should go straight for a complex implementation.  Quite the
opposite.  But I do want us to consider the possible ramifications of using a
single bit for all userfaults, so that we can at least try to design something
that is extensible and won't be a pain to maintain.
