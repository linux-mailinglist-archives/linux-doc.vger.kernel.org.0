I had a quick look.  Most users of d_sib walk from the parent->d_children
with the parent ->d_lock held, so they shouldn't notice a movement in
the list.
The two exceptions I could find are d_walk() and the readdir code in
libfs.c.
I think the main problem case would be if they were holding a dentry as
a cursor which transitioned when the parent d_lock is dropped and retaken.

d_walk already needs to cope with a concurrent rename messing with
its cursor so possibly something similar could be used to trigger a
restart.

libfs readdir walks from a DCACHE_DENTRY_CURSOR which will never
transition and so won't move spontaneously.  That is exactly as safe as
walking from the parent.

So I think d_walk() might need some help to avoid getting lost.  It could
probably simply check if its cursor changed ->d_inode between dropping
->d_lock and retaking it.  If it did, then restart.

It isn't clear to me that we can track a "end of positive" location.  I
think we would need to move negatives to the end and positives to the
start.  Can you see a down-side with doing that?

Thanks,
