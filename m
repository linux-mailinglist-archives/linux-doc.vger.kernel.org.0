I would still allocate gem objects for that.  Then use them as pool
instead of using them directly.

Not sure this is worth the trouble just for the cursors though as they
are big enough that page-sized allocations don't waste memory.

Note that there is a flag to change the allocation strategy
(TTM_PL_FLAG_TOPDOWN).  You could allocate the cursor objects
with the flag set.  Should be good enough to avoid fragmentation.

I have a patch doing exactly that for qxl, for the same reason:
https://git.kraxel.org/cgit/linux/commit/?id=e00e913a64c6fba9630b311f8bc71bd7c9842479
(no, that patch wasn't sent to the list yet).

We could do the same for vram and either let the driver explicitly ask
for top-down allocation, or use some threshold like the qxl patch.

So, I'm not convinced we actually need the drm_vram_buffer
infrastructure.

cheers,
  Gerd
