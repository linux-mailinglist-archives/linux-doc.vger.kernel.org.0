Why do you want to "stop" the user from doing something?  They asked to
do it, why prevent it?  If they ask to do something foolish, well, they
get to keep the pieces :)

vfio is a protocol on "the wire", right?  Not an ioctl.

You can't change ioctl structure sizes at any time.

You don't do that.

You create new ones, like everyone else does, as you can not change old
code.  By trying to "version" structures like this, it's just going to
be a nightmare.
