Hi Cornelia,

Thanks for the review. This is my first approach to virtio and I had to
make some assumptions myself from reading the code and the spec, so I
expected lots of corrections.

Ack, I'll split them in the next version.

I'll add that to v2.

You're right, I was focusing on the concrete example I was testing
instead.

Do you mean this? https://docs.oasis-open.org/virtio/virtio/
Or should I link the source repo instead?
https://github.com/oasis-tcs/virtio-spec

Got it.

Thanks, I'll make sure to rework this and to mention that you shouldn't
add a new out-of-spec device id.
