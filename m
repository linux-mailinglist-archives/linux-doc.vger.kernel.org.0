That's a good question. This same page describes the cycle of -rc
kernels as, "a normal series will get up to somewhere between -rc6 and
-rc9 before the kernel is considered to be sufficiently stable and the
final release is made."

In that context, I had read "stable" as in sufficiently stable, not as
"released by the stable team."

The author also did well at introducing the stable tree shortly after
that. "Once a stable release is made, its ongoing maintenance is passed
off to the 'stable team.'"

Personally, I think those clarifications make it okay to call v5.2
stable in this particular table. But there could be nuances with that
choice that I am missing.
