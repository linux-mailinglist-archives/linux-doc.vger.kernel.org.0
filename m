senpai is focused at estimating the ideal memory requirements without
affecting performance. And this covers the use case about reducing
memory footprint.

In my specific use-case (hibernation) I would let the system use as much
memory as possible if it's doing any activity (reclaiming memory only
when the kernel decides that it needs to reclaim memory) and apply a
more aggressive memory reclaiming policy when the system is mostly idle.

I could probably implement this behavior adjusting memory.high
dynamically, like senpai, but I'm worried about potential sudden large
allocations that may require to respond faster at increasing
memory.high. I think the user-space triggered memory reclaim approach is
a safer solution from this perspective.
