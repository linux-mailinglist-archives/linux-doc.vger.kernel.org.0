Actually, I've dropped this back out; it creates vast numbers of
warnings:

> Documentation/core-api/workqueue:398: ./include/linux/workqueue.h:3: WARNING: Duplicate C declaration, also

This will be the result of the ".. kernel-doc::" directives at the end,
which create new definitions (within sphinx) for all the symbols pulled
in.

In the long term, we may want to try to find some sort of fix for this.
But we're really just recreating a bunch of (English-language)
documentation that's already rendered once; I'm not sure it makes any
real sense to do that.  So I would suggest that, for now, when you are
translating documents with kernel-doc directives, you should leave those
directives out.  Stick in a note directing readers to the original if
they want to see that material...

Make sense?

Thanks,

jon
