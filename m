Hi Michael, thanks for reviewing:

linux-next, as stated in the cover letter:

    Tested on linux-next (next-20220802)

I just verified that the patch also applies to the vhost tree
(linux-next branch). Where did you test it?

That's a driver-specific consideration and this is supposed to be the
simplest possible driver skeleton, but ok.

This is a matter of style, I think. There are plenty of examples of this
in the kernel code, but I don't mind changing it.

Isn't that supposed to be done by module_virtio_driver()?

I already explained below that this is done by default after probe()
(see virtio_dev_probe()). virtio_device_ready() is supposed to be useful
only if you need to use the vqs in the probe function.

Ack.

Ok.

I'll check that out, thanks.
