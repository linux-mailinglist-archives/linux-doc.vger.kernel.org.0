Thanks for working on this.

I've verified that the message comes up at the right time (though before
waiting a half-hour for things to fail would be better :) and that
following the advice in the script makes the build work.  I *did* have
to do a "make cleandocs" after adding the fonts.conf file, though,
before the build would succeed.

So I've applied this, for now at least, but I do wonder: might it be
better to stash this fonts.conf file in-tree somewhere and just pull it
in automatically?  Would that create problems for anybody if we were to
do so?  That might be a bit nicer than failing and making people set up
the workaround on their own.

Meanwhile, it occurred to me that it would be good to let the Fedora
folks know that this breaks, so I've filed a bug there; we'll see if
they have any thoughts on the matter as well.

Thanks,

jon
