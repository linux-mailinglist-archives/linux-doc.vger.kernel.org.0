This reminds me of a sentence I once heard as an example of 
inscrutability.  Written without punctuation, it goes:

	Jack when Joe had had had had had had had had had had
	the teachers approval.

Properly punctuated, it says:

	Jack, when Joe had had "had", had had "had had"; "had had" had 
	the teacher's approval.

The context is supposed to be a comparison of the words two students 
used in their essays and how their teacher reacted.  It actually 
makes sense when read carefully.
