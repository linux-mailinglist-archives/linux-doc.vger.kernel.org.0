This is only correct if the SRP bit is set. If the SRP bit is unset, #WP
low still has no impact. And this is why setting the no-wp property
matters, because otherwise the SR_SRWD bit gets set at the first locking
command.

I disliked this behaviour as I actually got almost locked with
a non drivable #WP pin and had to play with pinctrl in order to force it
high and allow me to overwrite the SR_SRWD bit back.

Yes, that is the situation I met, it is not documented anywhere except
the code.

My intent with this paragraph was to hint people not to conduct these
tests under certain situations, but we can definitely improve that. What
about:

5) If your flash supports locking, please got through the following test
   procedure to make sure it correctly behaves.

   Warning: These tests may hard lock your device! Make sure:
   - The device is not hard locked already (#WP strapped to low and
     SR_SRWD bit set)
   - If you have a #WP pin, you may want to set `no-wp` in your DT for
     the time of the test, to only make use of software protection.

Please amend this text if you still think it is missing his goal.

I don't think so:
- first we lock the last two blocks (offset: size - 2 blocks, length: 2
  blocks)
- then we unlock the penultimate block so that only the last block
  remains locked (offset: size - 2 blocks, length 1).

I we were doing flash_lock -u <mtd> $(($size - (1 * $bs))) 1, we would
be asking to unlock the very last block and keep only the penultimate
block locked, which would not be supported.

Thanks,
