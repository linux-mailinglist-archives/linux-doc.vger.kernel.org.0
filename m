Which is fine - but the documentation should accurately reflect what
is happening on the system.
This is a new paragraph about the PID tracing or otherwise, Even if
some of the effects pre-date this patch, they have to be accurately
communicated.
I am also reading the new paragraph in the context of the rest of the
coresight.rst document - which is a user level document explaining the
basic operation of the coresight system and tools.
This document mentions no other perf command line parameters relevant
to coresight other than the @sink option.It actually calls out to the
OpenCSD docs to provide further information.

That's fine - I have no problem with contextID trace enabled by
default. Context ID is relatively low overhead - and only emitted at
start of trace  / context changes.
But the explanation of the parameters currently reads as though they
always have an effect - and not putting them in there will omit the
effect - unless you spot the very subtle line at the end.

The user does not need to know about parameters that have no effect!

Perhaps a better approach would be to explain the above - an explicit
statement that "perf will always enable PID/ contextID tracing at the
relevant EL - but for EL2 it is possible to make specific adjustments
using parameters......."

Cheers
