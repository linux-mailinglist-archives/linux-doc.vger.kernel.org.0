NAK because AI slop again obviously.

BTW we don't capitalise the first letter of subject lines. Even 5 minutes
glance at the mailing list would tell you that, and it's _yet more_
evidence for this being low-effort AI slop.

Even the patch subject line screams LLM-generated - and why are you
capitalising it as if vmalloc is abbreviated VCMA?...

Again you've not looked up who to cc- for this, you've got Claude to
generate a useless commit message so you demonstrate no understanding, the
documentation is pointless handwaving, etc.

Is this the only time we use it?

Kernel stacks are vmalloc()'d but a grep shows 0 results.

Also kvmalloc() shows zero results.

This is just useless AI slop handwaving that would need a total rewrite by
maintainers, so what use is this 'contribution'?

I love that you (read Claude) are vague about 'hundreds of terabytes', you
can literally see how much for 4 level and 5 level page tables...

Yeah no need to mention what PMD or PUD are...
