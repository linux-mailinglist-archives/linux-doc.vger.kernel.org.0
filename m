So, there's an issue here between the types and the documentation: while
this will eventually wrap around to 0, it will first go through the
negative value space (i.e. INT_MAX + 1 == INT_MIN, INT_MIN < 0).

Current users of atomic_t should already be expecting this, but does it
make sense?

i.e. should the documentation be updated to "wraps around to negative
values", or should the counter API be updated to force the unsigned
value:

+static inline u32 counter_atomic32_inc_return(struct counter_atomic32 *cntr)
+{
+	return (u32)atomic_inc_return(&cntr->cnt);
+}

I see many forcing the return type from atomic_*{read,return}*():

$ git grep -E '\((unsigned|unsigned int|u32)\).*\batomic.*(read|return)' | wc -l
67

My instinct is to say leave it "int" and adjust documentation, which is
the least disruptive, but I am enticed by the desire to make sure a
counter doesn't "misbehave" and go negative when the usage wants it
always positive.

This is testing that counter operations match native int operations,
which seems fine. I wonder if hard-coded values should be added too, to
just more directly map the explicit expectations? E.g. adding a second
test with each:

	test_counter_result_print32("Test underflow (int)",
				    start_val, end_val, start_val-1);
	test_counter_result_print32("Test underflow (-1)",
				    start_val, end_val, -1);


> +
> +	start_val = counter_atomic32_read(&ocnt);
> +	end_val = counter_atomic32_inc_return(&ocnt);

and:

	test_counter_result_print32("Test overflow (int)",
				    start_val, end_val, start_val+1);
	test_counter_result_print32("Test underflow (INT_MIN)",
				    start_val, end_val, INT_MIN);


Otherwise, yes, looks great; thank you!
