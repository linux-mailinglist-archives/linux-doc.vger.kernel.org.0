Yes, this is what I would do.

I don't believe you'll ever get to a point where it never breaks; that's
a *lot* of dependencies to track down.

I don't think it's worth it.  The number of people who *really* want to
build with a 2.4.4 system is, I believe, quite small; they may all be
copied on this email.  It is enough of a niche thing at this point that,
I think, we should not go to great lengths to support it.  Perhaps
somebody can contribute a document for folks who really want to do it.

I'm happy to not break 2.4.4 for now, though I suspect that day may
come.  But I think directing people toward such an old version is not
going to lead to long-term joy; for better or for worse, Sphinx has
moved on.
