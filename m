My main concern here is IIRC these are very much PSK / FSK devices with expectation
of symbol being externally controlled. (maybe I remembered that wrong ;)
So the symbol relationship would need to map to child channels in some fashion.

I'm kind of fine for that being needed for complex usecases but if I want
to do something simple I'd like that to be standard and intuitive.
Obviously gets blurry wrt to what counts as simple.

I did wonder if we should separate those but agree it's tricky.

Would have to be simple per channel sysfs attribute that would say
is this particular channel actually contributing to the current output.
Where it can contribute in multiple ways we'll need separate attributes.

Anything else is going to break the rules on one thing per each sysfs
attribute.
out_altvoltageXXX_phase_active
out_altvoltageXXX_freq_active
or something like that.

If folk are doing profile control from external pins I'd kind of expect to
see some description of what they are controlling even if it's read only.

Maybe we don't do this now but we should make sure there is space in the ABI
by thinking what it might look like.

return -EBUSY.   This is beyond the 'do sensible things' in intuitive way
boundary so I don't mind being a bit obtuse.

So it's last write that sets it.  We definitely need a way to know which
one is active if we get multiple writes.  What do the others return if they
were set but something else has been set since?

They'd have to sync that with the clock driving the ramp. I guess that's
possible - but nasty.  I vote we pretend this usecase doesn't exist for now ;)

Sigh. I don't have a good answer, but I don't like the weird 'special' nature
of this attribute.  I guess sometimes there isn't a good answer to be found.

OSK + RAM is odd enough that I'm not that bothered if we have to go weird
here.
