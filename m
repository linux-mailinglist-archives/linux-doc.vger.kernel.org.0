Right, I meant kexec/kdump. Given that it is easy to retrieve it in
kdump (presumably with some scripting?) I can remove this motivation
from the commit text.

Got it. Hopefully the links I provided were good enough? I will provide
a link next time.

Not exactly. I don't have a mapping of modules to the kernel they're
built/used with. I could create a mapping, but then that's something
else to maintain vs. what I have right now which is just a big database
of debuginfo mapped to build IDs (i.e. a debuginfod server).

Makes sense and sounds good. Thanks.
