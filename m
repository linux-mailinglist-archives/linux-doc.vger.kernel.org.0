I find "sector" more generic than "erase block" or even "blocks". A
"sector" meaning is intimately related to what the vendor wants a sector
to be, unlike a block that carries the historical flash-related meaning
of an erase block. I also have the maths definition in mind, which is
basically a start and end.

We can go for locked_blocks_map. Technically speaking, the size of a
block as defined in the BP bits is left to the vendor, it could very
well be any size I guess? So that sounds fine.

I understand that but there is still a race:
- swp.c writes cached_st[0]
- debugfs.c reads cached_st[0]
- swp.c writes cached_st[1]
- debugfs.c reads cached_st[1]

debugfs would get old st[0], new st[1]. The presence of the CMP bit in
st[1] really changes what st[0] means.

Questions is, do we care?

If yes, we can probably protect these cached registers inside the spi-nor
device lock.
