I thought to mention one thing to any reviewers that were going to
take a look at this after the discussion from v8.

One thing I was not super happy about with returning EOPNOTSUPP
directly is that it throws a checkpatch warning on all occurrences,
and when searching through the kernel I do not really see so many
other instances of returning pre-existing error codes as positive
values. If the direction that it went now with v9 is still desired,
but we do not want any kind of checkpatch warnings, I have thought
that maybe it would work to define my own symbol (such as
GB_NOT_SUPPORTED) and it can be any positive value I want (e.g. can
just be an alias directly to EOPNOTSUPP) and return / check for that
instead in these few "optional feature not supported" cases within
this driver. This does in fact feel a bit more "self-documenting", and
to be sure I did check to confirm and no checkpatch warnings are given
when doing it like this.

Does that sound preferred over what is currently here in this v9 (if
so I can send immediately as a v10 and everyone can ignore this v9) or
is it ok / not a problem that checkpatch will have these warnings on
returning positive standard error codes from these init functions?

Thanks again!

Best regards,
Joshua
