Ideally completely different DIMMs (though as you point out later, we can't
easily make this happen).

Right, I think that the approach you proposed is roughly equivalent spatially
(though I'd need to check with the safety folks here).

The notes I have from the research side of things (which should be taken with a
grain of salt) are something along the lines of:

  - ~79% are a single bit corruption
  - ~9% are row faults, so multiple bit corruption within ~8kb
  - ~4% are bank faults, so multiple bit corruption within ~512mb

Obviously the numbers would be very different depending on usecase, hardware,
physical location (did you know bits are more likely to flip in higher
altitudes?)...

For something like a datacenter deployment I'd agree with you - the odds are
too low to care. For an unsupervised self driving vehicle, where there's no
human (locally or remotely) available to take over, I'd like the odds to be as
low as possible :)
