I think these two points are fairly unrelated. The first is about
using the email address, for privacy concerns. The second point is
about adding the tag at all, which you're not allowed to do except for
Cc: tags. Because forging reviewed/acked/tested-by tags is really not
good. Putting the "no tag forgeries" rule under the privacy section is
I think what's confusing here.
