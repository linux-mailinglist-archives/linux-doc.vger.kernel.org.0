I think that's a separate topic, but that model is used on billions of
client devices :) The common runtime for apps and other core system
code is preloaded to significantly reduce app startup latencies.

Since we are interested in sharing text here, how does this play with
stuff like symbolization for call stacks? I believe this is another
reason where we might want to avoid mapping the pseudo mshare file
wrapper?

I agree the TLB shootdowns would be a pain. Perhaps, if there was a
concept of a shared ASID/PCID in the hardware, that would make things
less so ...

I think in the use case I described, it would mostly be sharing
MAP_PRIVATE stuff, and the access bit should still apply for global
reclaim. However, I agree it becomes difficult to reason especially if
you throw memcgs into the mix.
