What's wrong with the generic authorized proposal? The core can
default to deauthorizing devices on the platform bus, or any bus,
unless on an allow list. It's a bit more work to uplevel the local
"authorized" implementations from USB and Thunderbolt to the core, but
it's functionally identical to the "filter" approach in terms of
protection, i.e. avoiding probe of unnecessary unvetted drivers.

I see nothing that prevents a built-in allow list to augment the
driver-core default. Is there a gap I'm missing?
