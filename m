Indeed - CCA requires KVM to first "delegate" the page (effectively the
shared->private conversion) which will destroy the contents. Then we can
populate the data (but that obviously has to come from elsewhere).

The closest CCA can do to an in-place conversion is for the kernel to
copy the data to another temporary buffer and then the firmware can copy
it back after the delegation. An early version of the CCA Linux patches
did this (long before guest_memfd). However this is slower than it needs
to be (two copies) and difficult to size the temporary buffer. Too small
and you round-trip to the firmware more than you need to, too large and
you waste memory. And, with increasing support for huge pages in
guest_memfd and the CCA firmware (aka RMM), it's also challenging to
preserve huge pages while doing this dance so I want to avoid it if
possible.

At least in the Arm CCA case the "exposure" of the private memory is
only in terms of allowing population - and only before the guest has
run. The host isn't able to access the memory in any direct way after
the memory has been delegated. But the RMM provides this populate method
to copy data into memory (in a measured/controlled manner).

From a CCA perspective the logical flow is to mark the memory as private
and then call the platform-specific function to populate the memory. But
obviously we can fit in a KVM API which is different.

Note that CCA has a specific VM property called 'RIPAS' (Realm IPA
State). This is the guest's view of whether memory exists at a
particular physical address. My current series takes the view that all
guest_memfd memory is private RAM and the guest will have to
specifically request that it is converted to shared. I'm hoping this
series might provide a way for the VMM to configure this (before the
guest starts executing).

Steve
