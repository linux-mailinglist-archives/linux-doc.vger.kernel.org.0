2 pages per cpu, yes. ring_buffers can be resized on the fly, so it won't be too
hard to add a trace_size (Joonas asked for this too) node. I didn't add that now
since I wanted to prove out everything else before spending too much time on any
one solution (since this is the 3rd rewrite of drm tracing).

If we're all happy with the current direction, I'll add trace_size.

Thanks again for all the feedback,
