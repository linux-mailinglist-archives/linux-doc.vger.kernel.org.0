The "Select the recipients for your patch" part about CC-ing mailing
lists is a bit vague and might be understood that only some lists should
be Cc-ed.  That's not how most of maintainers expect.  For give code,
associated mailing list must be CC-ed, because the list is used for
reviewing and testing code.  Example are the Devicetree bindings
patches, which are tested iff Devicetree mailing list is CC-ed.

At least one person was arguing with me that CC-ing selective lists for
his patch (e.g. skipping list X for code X) is okay, thus let's be more
specific here.
