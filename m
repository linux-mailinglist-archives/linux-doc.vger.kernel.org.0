But do we actually need it here?

For threads already inside the body when killswitch is engaged: they just keep
executing the body to completion.

For threads at entry after the kprobe arms: pre-handler fires, they exit with
the override retval, never enter the body.

For threads arriving while the kprobe is being armed: kprobes-on-ftrace uses
ftrace's text_poke for atomic arm, so there's no "half-armed" window.

It's one of them, yes. I don't want to build my own kernel (and assume that
most distro users don't build their own kernel), so I can't enroll my own keys.

Outside of that, you would still need to have a patch-per-version (or at least,
per group of versions where the patch applies without conflicts).
