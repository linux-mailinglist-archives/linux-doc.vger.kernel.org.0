Also on anything that is remotely modern (i.e. runs a drm kernel
modesetting driver undearneath the fbdev/fbcon stack) there's a pile
more issues on top of just the scrollback/fbcon code being a mess.
Specifically the locking is somewhere between yolo and outright
deadlocks. This holds even more so if the use case here is "I want
scrollback for an oops". There's rough sketches for how it could be
solved, but it's all very tricky work.

Also, we need testcases for this, both in-kernel unit-test style stuff
and uapi testcases. Especially the full interaction on a modern stack
between /dev/fb/0, /dev/drm/card0, vt ioctls and the console is a pure
nightmare.

Altogether this is a few years of full time hacking to get this back
into shape, and until that's happening and clearly getting somewhere
the only reasonable thing to do is to delete features in response to
syzkaller crashes.

Also adding dri-devel since defacto that's the only place where
display people hang out nowadays.
