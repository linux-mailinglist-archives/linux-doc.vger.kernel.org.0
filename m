Did this analysis happen? Apologies if I missed it...

I'm a fan of turning on any of these "by default", as that's been the
historical approach, which tends to span years:

- security feature introduced, default off in the kernel
- distros enable it by default
- kernel makes it default on

So perhaps we're better off making the other hardening features on by
default since distros have been shipping with them for years now?
