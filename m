I don't see why you think that it's subjective in my workflow. It
isn't. The proposed patch and the officially submitted patch are
generally identical. The difference is, which thread is the more
useful thread to link the patch to - the one with the discussion
about the patch including why it's needed, or the official submission
that contains none of that.

I guess it depends whether you wish to capture the submission itself
or the actual useful discussion about the patch with the tag. If
we're going to be officially defining this tag, then really that
question needs to be settled.

What worries me at this point is that you seem to want to withdraw
from the discussion before any concensus has been reached, which
presents a problem for Linus' proposed patch...
