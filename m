Ok, I checked the code of cdomain.py. It sounds that Markus
tried to make cdomain compatible with Sphinx 3.x[1]:

	https://github.com/return42/linuxdoc/commit/48f09de2aff80169b7b9be5b0f2431ad8954e5cc

[1] Yet, he ended disabling cdomain.py at his latest commit there:

	https://github.com/return42/linuxdoc/commit/70673dcf69e705e08d81f53794895dc15c4920b3#diff-40ccfb63661f88fd819794047febd54d

    (Basically, if Sphinx > 3.0, the cdomain.py is just an alias for c.py)

I was hoping that porting such change would be enough for docs to build
with Sphinx 3.2, but it isn't[2]. It seems that the entire Cdomain code
was re-written:

	https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/commit/0f49e30c51b5cc5055cda5b4b294c2dd9d1df573#r38750737

There are now some environment vars that are required. Some of them
have things like:

        lastSymbol = self.env.temp_data['c:last_symbol']  # type: Symbol
        assert lastSymbol

If those aren't found, Sphinx crashes.

So, making anything that would be compatible with both Sphinx 2.x
and Sphinx 3.x seems very painful.

It sounds to me that we need to make a choice here about how to
proceed. We have a few alternatives:

1) stick forever with Sphinx 2.x syntax. We may end needing to 
   support a fork of Sphinx, if we follow this direction, as
   nobody currently fix bugs on older versions of Sphinx;

2) switch to use Sphinx 3.x c domains and drop support for
   version < 3.x;

3) copy the code from Sphinx 2.x c.py file into our cdomain.py,
   making it to work with both versions. We may have troubles
   with newer versions of Sphinx if we follow this path though.

If someone has enough time, one alternative would be to do a
a mix of (2) and (3) by first porting to Sphinx 3.x and then 
re-writing the code at cdomain.py for it to work as a "backport"
of the Sphinx 3.x c domain.

-

Assuming that we would take (1), I suspect that changing kernel-doc to
produce Sphinx 3 domain shouldn't be too hard, but I'm a little bit
afraid of namespace collisions. There is a new namespace directive 
there, introduced on Sphinx 3.1:

	.. c:namespace:: scope specification

We'll likely need to use things like these in order to avoid
namespace collisions, meaning that the new minimal version
would be 3.1.

Btw, with regards to namespace, there are two alternatives:

- the RST files that would need it would explicitly have
  such directive;

- the kernel-doc script could have a new option
  "namespace". If found, kernel-doc would output the
  namespace directive. IMO, this is more elegant.

In any case, "namespace" will break automarkup.py for symbols
that won't use the "NULL" namespace. Not sure how to fix it.

Comments?

Thanks,
Mauro
