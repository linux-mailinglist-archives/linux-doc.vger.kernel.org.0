Maybe. I tested those with Sphinx 2.0.1. Didn't test with older versions.

I'll do some tests with Sphinx 1.7.9 (with is the current minimal
recommended version) and do some cleanup on those references.

Unfortunately, the Kernel Sphinx image extension doesn't allow image scaling.

We had to add our own image extension at the Kernel, as otherwise,
for every image, we would need to add one parser for PDF and another
one for SVG. 

We would also need an extra parser for DOT.

Markus solved all the 3 image formats with a single extension, but
it currently doesn't allow passing the image size.

Markus,

Any reason for the kernel-image extension to not support scaling?

-

If this can't be easily solved at the kernel-image.py extension, a
simple alternative would be to simply scale the SVG file
directly. It should be trivial to re-scale with inkscape, although
the diff may be big.




Thanks,
Mauro
