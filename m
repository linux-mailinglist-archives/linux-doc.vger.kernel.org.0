Stephen asked me to not introduce a new clk op, however I don't see a
clean way to do this any other way. Personally, I think that we need a
new clk op for this use case for the reasons I outlined on the cover
letter. I am open for suggestions about alternative ways, and will
gladly make modifications. This is why I marked this series as RFC.
Patch 10 in this series is the main change of note here.

Additionally, the presence of the new op is a convenient way to also
signal to the clk core that these providers can use the v2 negotiation
logic. Otherwise, we'll need to introduce a flag somewhere else if we
want to support a v1/v2 negotiation logic across the clk tree.

As for 2), I negotiate the rate change from the top down. The new_rate
is propagated in the same manner as what's done today in the clk core
when a parent rate change occurs. I let it reuse the existing rate
change code that's currently in the clk core to minimize the change
that was introduced.

Regarding the clock table in 3), it could be done with what's there,
but there's the issue of the new clk_op. I posted this to get feedback
about that since I think we should settle on the core changes.
