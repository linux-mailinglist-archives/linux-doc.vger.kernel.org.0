Could you make a suggestion where to put it ?

I did not really explain my intention:
This was not intended as an introductory tutorial.

The intention is to provide a "Quick Start" for people
who know what they are doing in general, but simply do not
have any knowledge about the particular process involved
in submitting a Linux kernel patch.

I fully expect that someone who reads this at least knows:

- How to use git
- How to modify/configure/compile/test a kernel
- Has an idea what an SMTP server is
- ...

My personal problem was that I wanted to submit a patch.
I have no trouble compiling Linux kernels and working with git etc.
But I for sure did not have any idea at all how to convert a 
git commit into a patch for submission into the Linux kernel.

So the problem was only about what exactly should be send in
which format where.

I did not know about "git send-email"; I read about it somewhere.
I tried it and got "unknown command", because it seems most 
Linux distributions have that in a separate package.
I was wondering if I needed an extra special version of git.
After I found that I need to install an extra package,
I was wondering next if I need other software too
(like "exim" or "postfix" or "sendmail" or ...)

The intended audience of this primer are people who are
proficient with computers (they know about SMTP/MTAs/git ...)
but simply never submitted a Linux patch before.

I myself ended up sending the same patch at least three times
and I am still slightly embarrassed.

I think I actually did some small stuff on the  Linux kernel 
20 years ago maybe ?
Boy have things changed ;-) 
git did not exist back then, and I do not think "Signed-off-by",
was mentioned anywhere.

with best regards
