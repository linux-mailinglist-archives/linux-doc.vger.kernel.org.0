I like this text very much, it's concise and clear. My only possible
concern is that "explicit permission" isn't defined. I assume that
someone sendubg a Reviewed-by or Acked-by tag in a public mail thread
counts as permission, but strictly speaking it's not explicit.

Regardless of that, I think we can clarify what explicit permission
means in a follow-up patch. If you would like to merge this one as-is,

You have my explicit permission to include this tag in the commit :-D
