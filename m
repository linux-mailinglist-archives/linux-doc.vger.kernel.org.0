Can we just use cpufreq_get_hw_max_freq()?
We have cpufreq_get_hw_max_freq returning 0 in such case, so it should
be OK.

Is there a possibility that some platform which has !CONFIG_CPU_FREQ
would define its own cpu_get_max_freq() overwriting the weak function
above?
Based on the code which checks 'if (unlikely(!max_freq_hz))' it should,
otherwise 'valid_cpus' is not set.

I would assume that we won't see such platform, interested
in AMU freq invariance without CONFIG_CPU_FREQ.

We already have a lot of these defines or __weak functions, which is
hard to follow.

Apart from that and the issue with cpu_has_amu_feat() it looks good.

As Suzuki pointed out with 'amu_cpus', make sure we read
a one instance of mask here.
