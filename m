Point out that explicit permission is usually needed to tag other people
in changes, but mention that implicit permission can be sufficient in
certain cases. This fixes slight inconsistencies between Reported-by:
and Suggested-by: and makes the usage more intuitive.

While at it, explicitly mention the dangers of our bugzilla instance, as
it makes it easy to forget that email addresses visible there are only
shown to logged-in users.

The latter is not a theoretical issue, as one maintainer mentioned that
his employer received a EU GDPR (general data protection regulation)
complaint after exposing a email address used in bugzilla through a tag
in a patch description.

Jonathan, what do you think of this? I felt somewhat unsure about this a
few weeks ago, but I guess I was overly careful. If you think this
change is fine and shouldn't cause any trouble for anyone, feel free to
merge this. And if not, please speak up.

Note: this triggers a few checkpatch.pl complaints that are irrelevant
when when to comes to changes like this.

v4:
- slight wording change to make a implicity aspect explicit, as pointed
  out by Mauro
- Add reviewed-bys from Mauro and Shuah
- The number of reviewed-bys is still smal, nevertheless drop the
  DONOTMERGE and hole that Jonathan will speak up if he thinks this is
  a stupid move.

v3: https://lore.kernel.org/all/c29ef5fa12e37c3a289e46d4442b069af94e5b05.1733127212.git.linux@leemhuis.info/
- try yet again from a slightly different angle which loosens the rules
  slightly. This from review feedback to earlier versions is apparently
  what other developers want and from their "no lawyer" perspective
  consider to be okay. As IANAL myself I don't feel totally comfortable
  with this and have no idea if this legally is sound, so tag patch with
  "DONOTMERGE" for now; will remove this for v4 if enough people add a
  "Reviewed-by". Otherwise the story of this patch might end here, unless
  someone else submits it for inclusion (you are free to do so!).
- remote patch adding Suggested-by: tag to 5.Posting and submit it
  separately

v2: https://lore.kernel.org/all/cover.1731749544.git.linux@leemhuis.info/
- Retry differently. This slightly hardens the rule for Reported-by:
  while slightly lessening it for Suggested-by:. Those in the end are
  quite similar, so it does not make much sense to apply different ones.
  I considered using an approach along the lines of "if you reported it
  in pubic by mail, implicit permission to use in a tag is granted"; but
  I abstained from it, as I assume there are good reasons for the
  existing approach regarding Suggested-by:.
- CC all the people that provided feedback on the text changes in v1

v1: https://lore.kernel.org/all/f5bc0639a20d6fac68062466d5e3dd0519588d08.1731486825.git.linux@leemhuis.info/
