+title: ARM Coresight Cross Trigger Interface (CTI) device.
+
+description: |
+  The CoreSight Embedded Cross Trigger (ECT) consists of CTI devices connected
+  to one or more CoreSight components and/or a CPU, with CTIs interconnected in
+  a star topology via the Cross Trigger Matrix (CTM), which is not programmable.
+  The ECT components are not part of the trace generation data path and are thus
+  not part of the CoreSight graph described in the general CoreSight bindings
+  file coresight.txt.
+
+  The CTI component properties define the connections between the individual
+  CTI and the components it is directly connected to, consisting of input and
+  output hardware trigger signals. CTIs can have a maximum number of input and
+  output hardware trigger signals (8 each for v1 CTI, 32 each for v2 CTI). The
+  number is defined at design time, the maximum of each defined in the DEVID
+  register.
+
+  CTIs are interconnected in a star topology via the CTM, using a number of
+  programmable channels, usually 4, but again implementation defined and
+  described in the DEVID register. The star topology is not required to be
+  described in the bindings as the actual connections are software
+  programmable.
+
+  In general the connections between CTI and components via the trigger signals
+  are implementation defined, except when the CTI is connected to an ARM v8
+  architecture core and optional ETM.
+
+  In this case the ARM v8 architecture defines the required signal connections
+  between CTI and the CPU core and ETM if present. In the case of a v8
+  architecturally connected CTI an additional compatible string is used to
+  indicate this feature (arm,coresight-cti-v8-arch).
+
+  When CTI trigger connection information is unavailable then a minimal driver
+  binding can be declared with no explicit trigger signals. This will result
+  the driver detecting the maximum available triggers and channels from the
+  DEVID register and make them all available for use as a single default
+  connection. Any user / client application will require additional information
+  on the connections between the CTI and other components for correct operation.
+  This information might be found by enabling the Integration Test registers in
+  the driver (set CONFIG_CORESIGHT_CTI_INTEGRATION_TEST in Kernel
+  configuration). These registers may be used to explore the trigger connections
+  between CTI and other CoreSight components.
+
+  Certain triggers between CoreSight devices and the CTI have specific types
+  and usages. These can be defined along with the signal indexes with the
+  constants defined in <dt-bindings/arm/coresight-cti-dt.h>
+
+  For example a CTI connected to a core will usually have a DBGREQ signal. This
+  is defined in the binding as type PE_EDBGREQ. These types will appear in an
+  optional array alongside the signal indexes. Omitting types will default all
+  signals to GEN_IO.
+
+  Note that some hardware trigger signals can be connected to non-CoreSight
+  components (e.g. UART etc) depending on hardware implementation.
