Sorry for the delay again. Now that I'm back there should not be any
more of them.
I thought more about these alternative suggestions for userspace to
record allocations but that would introduce considerable complexity
into userspace. Userspace would have to collect and consolidate this
data by some daemon, all users would have to query it for the data
(IPC or something similar), in case this daemon crashes the data would
need to be somehow recovered. So, in short, it's possible but makes
things much more complex compared to proposed in-kernel
implementation.
OTOH, the only downside of the current implementation is the
additional memory required to store anon vma names. I checked the
memory consumption on the latest Android with these patches and
because we share vma names during fork, the actual memory required to
store vma names is no more than 600kB. Even on older phones like Pixel
3 with 4GB RAM, this is less than 0.015% of total memory. IMHO, this
is an acceptable price to pay.
