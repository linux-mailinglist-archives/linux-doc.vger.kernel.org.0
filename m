Hence, "feels".

This could perhaps be refined, but I didn't see an obvious reason to
change the way this works, right now.

Or, is there a problem here that I'm missing?

Architecturally, ceil(100.0 / (1 << b)), where 1 <= b <= 16.

So, the possible values are

	1, 2, 4, 7, 13, 25, 50

(with 25 and 50 being the only ones that are exact).

In practice, something like 6 <= b <= 8 is probably more typical; this
would give advertised bandwidth_gran values of 2 or 1.


Re your question about existing usage, were you suggesting
unconditionally setting bw_gran to 1?

Since the values are converted to/from hardware representation in
resctrl_arch_update_domains() / resctrl_arch_get_config(), we
don't have a problem, provided that the value doesn't get rounded in
advance by bw_validate().

But if bw_gran is always 1, it will mislead userspace about the
precision.  This feels stranger for userspace than fine differences in
precisely which percentage values get read out of schemata.

> What will these control steps actually look like when the user views the schemata file

It depends on the number of bits in the hardware value (the parameter b
above).  Picking the smallest, non-trivial value 3:

	schemata	hardware (MBW_MAX)

	 13		0
	 25		1
	 38		2
	 50		3
	 63		4
	 75		5
	 88		6
	100		7

As currently implemented, I believe that writing the values from the
"schemata" column above will result in the corresponding values from
the "hardware" column being written to the hardware.  Achitecturally,
there is no guaranteed representation for 0%; we would advertise min=13,
max=100 in info/.)

A round-to-nearest policy is followed for intermediate values on write.

	(hardware value = round(schemata value * 8.0 / 100.0) - 1).)

Reading the value back translates the value from the "hardware" column
back to the unique value in the "schemata" column.

	(schemata value = round((hardware value + 1) * 100.0 / (1 << b)).)


In this case, bandwidth_gran would be advertised as 13, which is the
largest step that can be seen in the read-back values.


I would rather avoid promising precisely which values can be read out;
merely that they are consistent with the approximate precision defined
by the bandwidth_gran parameter.

No guarantee, but there will only be one resctrl_arch_preconvert_bw()
per arch.  We'd expect the functions to be simple, so this doesn't feel
like an excessive maintenance burden?

(All the resctrl_arch_foo() hooks have to do the right thing after all,
otherwise nothing will work.)


With this patch, resctrl_arch_preconvert_bw() and
resctrl_arch_{update_domains,get_config}() between them must provide
the correct behaviour.

But even today, resctrl_arch_update_domains() and
resctrl_arch_get_config() have to do the right thing in order for
bandwidth control values to be handled correctly, as seen through the
schemata interface.

(x86's job is easy, because the generic interface between the resctrl
core and the arch interface happens to be expressed in terms of raw x86
MSR values due to the history.  But other arches don't get the benefit
of that.)


The reason for this patch is the generic code can't do the right thing
for MPAM, unless there is a hook into the arch code, arch-/hardware-
specific knowledge is added in the core code, or unless a misleading
bw_gran value is advertised.

I tried to take the pragmatic approach, but I'm open to suggestions if
you'd prefer this to be factored in another way.

There doesn't feel like a magic solution here.

Exact bandwidth and flow control behaviour is extremely dependent on
hardware topology and the design of interconnects and on dynamic system
load.  An interface that is generic and rigorously defined, yet also
simple enough to be reasonably usable by portable software would
probably not be implementable on any real hardware platform.

So, if it's useful to have a generic interface at all, hardware and
software are going to have to meet in the middle somewhere...

(The historical behaviour -- and even the interface -- of MB is not
generic either, right?)

Cheers
---Dave
