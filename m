I do understand that dilemma, but am not sure what the happy medium is
between rendering them and hiding them. Where I see value is:

1. For anyone reading/writing abstractions, it's useful to quickly see
how exactly bindgen did the C -> Rust mapping
2. Abstractions may want to link to the C side somehow, linking the
bindings is an easier first step than linking to sphinx (in the future
we may be able to do a bindings -> sphinx link)

Maybe a stronger "prefer abstractions over bindings" message would
suffice to discourage use outside of reference?

In any case, I will put this behind a flag so it is not enabled by
default. While I'm at it - is there value in adding a config option to
pass `--document-private-items` to the kernel crate, or supporting
`RUSTDOCFLAGS` like Cargo does?

That makes sense, I will add the flag option.

I will add this in a separate patch.

How would switching to the library work? Since that seems like a more
involved discussion, would postprocesing `generated_bindings.rs` be
acceptable instead? I have been playing around with a python script
that extracts the `#[doc ...]` blocks and (1) fixes the escaping and
(2) formats parameters and fixes their spacing, I could extract this
to a separate patch if it may be a while before we can use the
library.

Ah thanks, it just looks a bit weird in the diff.
