I am looking forward to the discussion on this interface!

To help boost the discussion and progress, I would like to share a few of my thoughts.
We could either introduce a new interface to trigger demotion/promotion,
or we could reuse the existing one (using tier just internally)

Based on the memcg interface currently proposed in swap_tier
(memory.swap.tiers, memory.swap.tiers.effective), I think it aligns well
with the current direction. It provides a foundation for selectively
targeting devices in tier order.

To summarize the discussions so far, the following points align well.

- Per-cgroup swap control, as I suggested.
- Proactive zswap writeback (Hao's usecase)
- Swap device target demotion(if it wants selective, then it is more better), as you mentioned:
  https://lore.kernel.org/linux-mm/aicZ-5GX9De3MAU7@linux.dev/
- Virtual Swap on/off in the future, as Nhat mentioned:
  https://lore.kernel.org/linux-mm/20260528212955.1912856-1-nphamcs@gmail.com/
- The memory.zswap.writeback alternative (no hierarchy model conflict)
- zswap is first swap tier.
- Promotion. (Also better for selectve usage)
- tier based swap policy (e.g round-robin...)

To accelerate this work, I believe we should reach a consensus and
merge the currently proposed swap_tier interface :)

If the above approach is difficult, I would like to suggest an
alternative for progress with the memcg interfaces removed:

1) We could make zswap the first tier and create
a use case where memory.zswap.writeback internally is handled by tier logic.

2) Or simply merge the swap_tier infrastructure itself first.

This would allow the swap_tier infrastructure to be merged and discussed
more easily.

If it takes longer to adopt swap_tier anyway, by doing so we progress next step
as a experimental feature.

- Apply per-cgroup swap as an experimental (debugfs) feature.
- Apply Hao's use case experimentally or as it is as Yosry suggested.
(future migration to swap tier)

How do you think?

(FYI: My emails to kernel.org are failing due to internal server issues.)

Thank you 
Youngjun Park
