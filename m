As per the long discussion in response to patch #4, I think there are
still open questions about the later patches in this series. However,
I could land patches #1 - #3 if there are no concerns. Would anyone
object if I just landed them straight from this series with Linus's
review, or would I need to repost just patches #1 - #3 without the
"RFC" tag?

Thanks!
