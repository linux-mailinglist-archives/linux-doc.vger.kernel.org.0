Replace the stock search page with a kernel-specific search UI
that still builds on Sphinx-generated search data.

Results are grouped into Symbols, Sections, Index entries, and
Pages. The advanced panel adds filters for documentation area,
object type, result kind, and exact identifier matching while
preserving shareable URL state. Result kinds are presented as tabs
so broad searches can switch between them without scrolling through
large sections.

Page summaries are fetched only for the Pages result kind. The
default view limits summaries to the first 50 page results while
allowing a per-session opt-out for deeper summary loading. Summary
loading is deferred to the active Pages view, and stale work is
canceled when the query or active result kind changes.

The sidebar search template is replaced with a matching quick-search
entry point that links to the advanced search page.

The runtime includes compatibility handling for the supported Sphinx
range, including older search-index layouts and pre-9.x stopword
APIs. On Sphinx 3.4.3 through 5.1.x, advanced search degrades
gracefully to Symbols and Pages because those versions do not emit
the section and index metadata available in 5.2.0 and newer.

A lightweight build-time smoke test is included for the generated
search page, copied runtime asset, and search-index contract.

Summary
=======

This feature adds an Advanced Search interface for kernel
documentation. It is intended to provide a more capable complement to
regex and grep than the existing Quick Search interface, while still
building on the same underlying Sphinx search primitives.

It organizes results into Symbols, Sections, Index entries, and Pages,
while also exposing filters and more targeted identifier search.

The implementation stays close to the existing Sphinx search model. It
reuses existing Sphinx-generated search artifacts and adds a client-side
interface around them, rather than introducing a separate indexing
pipeline, non-Sphinx search backend, or additional build-time
infrastructure.

It is intended to remain broadly compatible with supported Sphinx
builds and to work with both in-tree and out-of-tree documentation
builds.

It also changes the runtime cost shape of documentation search. In the
default view, advanced search renders grouped results without triggering
page-summary fetches, and in limited Pages mode it loads only the
rendered page summaries, up to 50. On broader queries, that
substantially reduces request volume and transferred bytes compared with
the stock Quick Search page.


Problem and Purpose
===================
The need for this feature can be understood through this context
sequence:

1. Kernel contributors and documentation readers need to navigate a
   very large body of material spread across many subsystems, APIs,
   generated reference pages, and long-form documents, often without
   already knowing which page contains the thing they need.

2. Regex and grep are powerful for precise text hunting in a local
   source tree, but they are not ideal for finding the right rendered
   documentation page, section, or symbol when the user does not
   already know where to look.

3. The existing quick search provides a useful lightweight entry point,
   but it does not expose richer filtering, result grouping, or more
   targeted identifier search workflows. On broader queries, it also
   scales page-summary loading work with result breadth, which makes
   the experience both noisier and more resource-intensive than it
   needs to be.

4. Maintenance of complex front-end systems is a higher barrier in this
   environment because there are fewer contributors focused on front-end
   implementation details. For that reason, safer solutions should stay
   within the existing documentation infrastructure rather than
   introducing additional dependencies or separate supporting systems.

Taken together, these constraints favor a solution that improves
navigation within rendered documentation while remaining within the
existing documentation infrastructure and search model.


Design Goals
============

- Expose more structured search workflows than Quick Search.
- Keep the implementation aligned with established documentation
  architecture to limit maintenance and onboarding overhead.
- Remain easy to disable or roll back if needed.
- Allow for future filter adjustment or expansion without restructuring
  the system.
- Use standard HTML form semantics rather than custom widget frameworks.
- Keyboard navigation and standard accessible form semantics with no
  custom focus management.
- Maintain broad Sphinx version compatibility.
- Work with both in-tree and out-of-tree documentation builds.

Anti-goals
==========

- Replacing regex or grep.
- Introducing a separate search backend.
- Adding new build-time dependencies.
- Altering build-time processes
- Adding low-value bells and whistles that increase complexity.
- Redesigning the theme.
- Redesigning the sidebar search.


Design & Implementation
=======================

Architecture Overview
---------------------

This feature is implemented by extending the Sphinx documentation setup
already used by the kernel tree, rather than by introducing a separate
search backend or indexing pipeline.

Sphinx already provides several useful extension points for this kind of
feature. It allows template overrides through the configured template
path, static asset overrides through the configured static path, and it
generates search artifacts such as `searchindex.js` and
`language_data.js` as part of the normal documentation build.

Those existing hooks define the basic boundaries of the implementation.
The feature can replace or extend the rendered search UI, add client-side
behavior, and reuse Sphinx-generated search data, but it does not create
its own independent search index or separate documentation build system.

Baseline Search Structure
-------------------------

The default Sphinx setup already provides a basic quick-search entry
point and the generated search artifacts needed for client-side
searching.

In the kernel documentation build, this means the existing setup already
exposes:

* a sidebar quick-search box
* a generated `searchindex.js` file
* generated `language_data.js` search-language support
* the stock Sphinx search page and initialization model

What it does not provide is a richer search workflow tailored to kernel
documentation navigation. In particular, the default flow does not
provide grouped results, richer filtering, or a dedicated search
interface for navigating symbols, sections, index entries, and pages as
distinct result kinds.

Template Integration
--------------------

The feature is integrated through two Sphinx template overrides:

* `Documentation/sphinx/templates/searchbox.html`
* `Documentation/sphinx/templates/search.html`

`searchbox.html` serves as the sidebar entry point. It is effectively a
close copy of the theme's default quick-search component, but adds a
dedicated link to `search.html?advanced=1` so the full search page opens
with the advanced filters enabled.

`search.html` provides the full Advanced Search page. It defines the
search query field, the advanced filter controls, and the results
container that is later populated by
`Documentation/sphinx-static/kernel-search.js`.

The feature is also trivial to rollback. Because the integration is
implemented as template overrides, rollback only requires deleting
`searchbox.html` and `search.html`. That restores the original default
Sphinx theme templates (including Quick Search) without untangling
architecture, altering configuration, or reverting history.

User Interface and Styling
--------------------------

The user-facing interface is defined in `search.html` and styled in
`Documentation/sphinx-static/custom.css`.

The markup in `search.html` is a shared contract with
`kernel-search.js` and `custom.css`. The JavaScript runtime depends on
specific form IDs and result container IDs, while the CSS depends on the
corresponding classes. Changes to the template markup therefore need to
be made with both files in mind.

At a high level, the page provides:

* a search query field
* a submit action and progress/status area
* a collapsible advanced-filter panel
* result-kind filters
* documentation-area and object-type filters
* a runtime-rendered tabbed results interface
* a Pages summary-loading mode toggle

That runtime-rendered results interface is built by
`kernel-search.js`. It renders result tabs for Symbols, Sections, Index
entries, and Pages, along with per-kind result panels. The Pages tab
includes its own summary-loading mode control so the user can switch
between the normal limited mode and a broader unbounded mode directly
within that view when needed.

The CSS in `custom.css` is responsible for the layout and responsive
presentation of the search interface. In particular, it supports the
tabbed results UI and keeps the result tabs sticky so users can switch
between result kinds at any time while searching, even when the result
lists are long.

The templates use standard accessible form semantics, including labeled
controls, grouped filter fields, and a collapsible advanced-filter
panel.

JavaScript Runtime Flow
-----------------------

The client-side runtime is implemented in
`Documentation/sphinx-static/kernel-search.js`.

At a high level, the flow is:

1. `search.html` includes `_static/language_data.js`,
   `kernel-search.js`, and the generated `searchindex.js`.

2. `kernel-search.js` waits for `searchindex.js` to populate the shared
   `Search` index.

3. The runtime reads query state from the page and URL parameters.

4. The query is normalized and prepared for matching.

5. The runtime searches across Sphinx-generated index structures and
   collects matches as distinct result kinds: Symbols, Sections, Index
   entries, and Pages.

6. The collected matches are scored, grouped, filtered, and rendered
   into the results container in `search.html`.

7. For page results, summaries may be fetched lazily from generated HTML
   pages after the initial result set is rendered.

Page Summaries and Runtime Cost
-------------------------------

The most important runtime distinction from the stock search page is how
page summaries are loaded.

In the default advanced-search view, grouped results are rendered
without triggering page-summary fetches. Page summaries are fetched only
when the user switches to the Pages tab.

In that Pages view, the normal mode is intentionally limited. It loads
only the rendered page summaries, up to a maximum of 50. For smaller
queries, that means loading all rendered page summaries when fewer than
50 exist. For broader queries, that keeps page-summary work bounded
instead of scaling with the full result set.

This means the feature does not remove the shared Sphinx startup and
search-index load cost. The main runtime change happens after initial
results are available: the advanced interface reduces the amount of
follow-on summary-loading work, especially for broader queries.

Extensibility
-------------

The current structure is intended to support incremental changes within
the existing search model.

In practice, that means it is straightforward to:

- add or adjust filters in ``search.html``
- add corresponding styling in ``custom.css``
- extend query handling and result collection in ``kernel-search.js``
- tune ranking and grouping behavior within the existing client-side
  runtime

This makes the feature reasonably extensible for incremental search UI
and result-model improvements, while still keeping the implementation
contained within the existing Sphinx template and static-asset model.

Sphinx Version Compatibility
----------------------------

Sphinx version compatibility is handled in `kernel-search.js` by
accounting for the meaningful differences in generated search data
across supported versions.

The main compatibility differences are:

* stopword representation
* object index layout
* availability of section and index-entry metadata

Sphinx 3.4.3 through 8.2.3 expose stopwords in a form that behaves like
an array. Sphinx 9.1.0 exposes stopwords in a form that behaves like a
set. The runtime includes compatibility handling for both
representations.

The generated object index also differs across versions. Sphinx 3.4.3
uses a name-to-tuple mapping for object entries, while Sphinx 4.0 and
newer use an array-based layout. The runtime supports both forms when
collecting Symbol results.

The most visible functional difference is that Sphinx 3.4.3 through
5.1.x do not emit the `alltitles` and `indexentries` metadata used to
populate Sections and Index entries. Because of that, that range
provides partial support: Symbols and Pages still work, but expect
fewer total results because Sections and Index entries are unavailable.

Sphinx 5.2.x and newer provide full support.


Compatibility
=============

This feature works with both in-tree and out-of-tree documentation
builds.

The interface requires JavaScript at runtime.

Sphinx 5.2 and newer provide full support.

Sphinx 3.4.3 through 5.1.x provide partial support. In that range, the
feature remains usable, but older Sphinx builds do not emit the
metadata needed for Sections and Index entries. As a result, expect
fewer total results, with only Symbols and Pages available.

This behavior was directly validated on:

- Sphinx 9.1.0
- Sphinx 8.2.3
- Sphinx 3.4.3 on Python 3.9

For example, searching for `futex` under full support returns 280
results. On Sphinx 3.4.3, the same search returns 223 results: 200
Symbols and 23 Pages, with no Sections or Index entries.

This runtime behavior was benchmarked on Sphinx 9.1.0 against stock
Quick Search using the queries `kernel`, `futex`, and `landlock`.
Across that set, advanced search kept the default path flat at zero
page-summary requests and 12 total requests, while stock summary work
grew with query breadth. In limited Pages mode, advanced search loaded
10 page summaries for `landlock`, 23 for `futex`, and 50 for `kernel`.


Trade-offs
==========

This feature accepts some additional template, CSS, and JavaScript
complexity in exchange for a more structured and useful search workflow
than the existing Quick Search interface can provide.

At the same time, it avoids a much larger architectural jump. Rather
than introducing a separate indexing pipeline, non-Sphinx backend, or
additional build-time infrastructure, it stays within the existing
Sphinx search model and reuses Sphinx-generated search artifacts.

That design keeps the feature more contained, easier to integrate, and
trivial to rollback, but it also means the feature remains bounded by
the data that Sphinx already emits.

One explicit compatibility trade-off is that Sphinx 3.4.3 through 5.1.x
provide only partial support. Supporting those versions fully would
require additional compatibility logic for metadata they do not emit.
Instead, the feature accepts degraded results in that range while
keeping full support on newer Sphinx versions.

This is not a universal first-summary latency win. On broad queries such
as `kernel`, the stock search page can reach a first resolved summary
sooner, but it does so by issuing far more requests and transferring far
more data. The performance advantage of advanced search is that it
reduces summary-loading work and keeps that work bounded as query
breadth increases.

So the overall trade-off shape is:

- more capability than Quick Search, but more complexity to maintain
- less complexity than a separate search architecture, and lower
  maintenance and learning overhead because it stays within the
  existing Sphinx infrastructure.
- broad support across Sphinx versions, but not uniform support on
  earlier versions to avoid greater maintenance complexity.
- another subsystem to maintain, but trivial to rollback if needed.


Maintenance and Risk Considerations
===================================

The main maintenance burden comes from the fact that this feature is a
coordinated template/CSS/JavaScript unit rather than a single isolated
change. `search.html`, `searchbox.html`, `custom.css`, and
`kernel-search.js` depend on a shared contract of markup structure, IDs,
and classes. Changes in one of those files may require corresponding
changes in the others.

A second maintenance risk is Sphinx-version drift. The feature relies on
Sphinx-generated search data and therefore depends on the structure and
availability of that data remaining compatible enough for the runtime to
interpret it correctly. The main known variation points are stopword
representation, object index layout, and metadata availability for
Sections and Index entries. Future Sphinx releases may require renewed
validation or additional compatibility handling.

The feature also depends on generated HTML structure when deriving page
summaries. If the relevant page markup changes, summary extraction may
degrade even if the underlying search index still works correctly. That
makes summary behavior one of the more fragile parts of the runtime.

Theme and layout changes are another practical risk. The feature is
integrated through kernel-local template overrides and styling, so
changes to surrounding layout expectations may require corresponding
adjustments to searchbox integration, page structure, or responsive
presentation.

These risks are mitigated by keeping the feature within the existing
Sphinx extension points, avoiding new build-time dependencies or a
separate search backend, validating behavior across supported Sphinx
versions with the smoke test in `tools/docs/test_advanced_search.py`
and the developer-side benchmark harness in
`tools/docs/bench_search_playwright.mjs`, and keeping rollback simple
through removal of the template overrides and static assets. The
benchmark harness is a developer tool for validation and comparison,
not a dependency of the documentation build itself.

v3:
- Reworked the results UI from collapsible groups to a tabbed interface.
- Added sticky result tabs so result-kind switching remains available
  while browsing long result lists.
- Added a Pages summary-loading mode control to the Pages view.
- Hardened Pages summary loading so it starts only when the Pages view
  is opened, reuses fetched page text within the page session, applies
  bounded concurrent loading, and supports a limited mode that caps
  rendered page summaries at 50.
- Clarified and expanded Sphinx compatibility handling, including
  graceful degraded behavior on older builds.
- Added a build-time smoke test for advanced-search assets and search
  page wiring.
- Added integration, compatibility, testing, and rollback
  documentation.
- Added a MAINTAINERS entry for the main feature file.

+Advanced Search Integration
+---------------------------
+
+The advanced search integration is a kernel-specific Sphinx
+customization that overrides the stock search page and sidebar
+quick-search template to provide a more capable search interface for
+kernel documentation while still building on the same underlying
+Sphinx search primitives.
+
+The advanced search integration is implemented by three files:
+
+* ``Documentation/sphinx/templates/search.html`` for the custom search page;
+* ``Documentation/sphinx/templates/searchbox.html`` for the sidebar link;
+* ``Documentation/sphinx-static/kernel-search.js`` for the client-side
+  search runtime.
+
+The page relies on a strict boot order. ``language_data.js`` must load
+before ``kernel-search.js``, and ``searchindex.js`` must load afterwards
+to populate the shared search index consumed by the runtime.
+
+The runtime works with all supported Sphinx versions, but the available
+result kinds differ by the metadata present in ``searchindex.js``:
+
+* Sphinx ``3.4.3`` through ``5.1.x`` provide ``Symbols`` and ``Pages``.
+  ``Sections`` and ``Index entries`` are unavailable because those
+  versions do not emit the ``alltitles`` and ``indexentries`` fields.
+* Sphinx ``5.2.0`` and newer provide the full result set: ``Symbols``,
+  ``Sections``, ``Index entries``, and ``Pages``.
+
+Runtime behavior is intentionally bounded, but still fully client-side:
+
+* ``searchindex.js`` is loaded into the browser before any query can run,
+  and broad full-site builds can still increase page-load and query latency.
+* The ``Pages`` group starts collapsed. Page-summary fetches begin only
+  after the user opens that group.
+* Page summaries are fetched on demand after the user opens the
+  ``Pages`` group. Browsers with ``IntersectionObserver`` keep that work
+  near the viewport, with at most four concurrent requests, an
+  eight-second timeout, and a limit of fifty summarized page results per
+  query.
+* Successful summary fetches are cached for the current page session.
+  Aborted or failed fetches are not cached, and the result remains usable
+  as a normal link even when its summary is unavailable.
+
+If full-site ``searchindex.js`` size becomes the bottleneck, that needs a
+larger follow-up design such as precomputed summary sidecars, sharded
+search data, or a server-backed search service. The client-side runtime
+described here does not solve that class of scaling limit.
+
+For a quick local regression check, run::
+
+	python3 tools/docs/test_advanced_search.py
+
+It builds a small documentation subset and verifies the generated search
+page, copied static assets, and the search index contract used by the
+client-side search runtime.
+
+To verify full-site support for a change, also run at least one full
+``make htmldocs`` build and manually exercise the generated ``search.html``
+page.
+
+To disable the feature and return to the theme's default Quick Search setup,
+remove the two template overrides:
+
+* ``Documentation/sphinx/templates/search.html``
+* ``Documentation/sphinx/templates/searchbox.html``
+
+That restores the native Sphinx search page and the default sidebar quick
+search box. ``kernel-search.js`` can then be removed as follow-up cleanup,
+but removing the two template overrides is enough to roll back behavior.
+
 .. [#ink] Having ``inkscape(1)`` from Inkscape (https://inkscape.org)
 	  as well would improve the quality of images embedded in PDF
 	  documents, especially for kernel releases 5.18 and later.
