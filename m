In the driver core? No, not so much, and I do remember it flying by,
just did not connect the dots. In fact, it had just gone upstream when
you and I had that thread about blocking PCI drivers [1], September
2017 vs June 2017 when the Thunderbolt connection manager was merged.
There was no internal review process back then so I failed to
internalize its implications for this TDX filter. You had taken the
time to review it in a way that I had not.

I have added, "review driver core attribute proposal for duplication
of bus-local capabilities" to my review checklist.

The good news is I think this generic authorization support in the
core may answer one of Jonathan's questions about how to integrate PCI
SPDM/CMA support [2].
