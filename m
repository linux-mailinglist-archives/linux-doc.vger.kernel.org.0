That was indeed helpful for reviewing, thank you!

Thank you, I will do!

Thank you for sharing the pain point.  I recently added a few more DAMOS
tracepoints motivated by our offline discussion.  I'm planning to add better
supports of those in DAMON user-space tool.  Knowing this kind of pain points
is essential and useful at improving DAMON, thank you!

Thank you for flexibly accepting my suggestion!

More than exciting to hear that :D

Sounds perfect, I hope you to have great break!
