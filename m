To begin with, please do not send HTML mail, it won't make it through to
the lists.

These are, of course, quite old kernels.

Required by who?  That is an ancient version of Sphinx at this point.

Current Sphinx works fine, as far as I know; are there specific problems
that you can report with current kernels?

Again, those are very old kernels, that you are trying to make work with
a very old version of Sphinx.  I'm not sure why those patches would be
useful to anybody else?

This, too, is not appropriate to send within our development community.
