Thanks for looking at my attempt to patch the documentations.

I tried to create an improved patch:
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-doc/20230902210422.8092-1-mail@renenyffenegger.ch/T/

However, I did not receive any feedback. So, I am wondering if I am
still making mistakes. In order to improve, I'd appreciate a feedback
what I need to change to create the patch.

Thanks

René
