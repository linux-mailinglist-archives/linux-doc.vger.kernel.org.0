I'll revise the first paragraph as follows:
As we have mentioned, each zone in memory is described by a ``struct zone``
which is an element of the ``node_zones`` array of the node it belongs to. 
``struct zone`` is the core data structure of the page allocator. A zone
represents a range of physical memory and may have holes.

I'll change it to "When the amount of free pages in a zone is below the min
watermark, boosting is ignored..." as suggested. Other watermark descriptions

People who read this section will probably also read the source code, so mentioning the

I'll change the description as follows:
  The array of the amounts of the memory reserved in this zone for memory
  allocations. For example, if the highest zone a memory allocation can
  allocate memory from is ``ZONE_MOVABLE``, the amount of memory reserved in
  this zone for this allocation is ``lowmem_reserve[ZONE_MOVABLE]`` when
  attempting to allocate memory from this zone. This is a mechanism the page
  allocator uses to prevent allocations which could use ``highmem`` from using
  too much ``lowmem``. For some specialised workloads on ``highmem`` machines,
  it is dangerous for the kernel to allow process memory to be allocated from
  the ``lowmem`` zone. This is because that memory could then be pinned via the
  ``mlock()`` system call, or by unavailability of swapspace.
  ``vm.lowmem_reserve_ratio`` sysctl determines how aggressive the kernel is in
  defending these lower zones. This array is recalculated by
  ``setup_per_zone_lowmem_reserve()`` at runtime if ``vm.lowmem_reserve_ratio``
  sysctl changes.

I'll update it as follows:
  The array of free areas, where each element corresponds to a specific order
  which is a power of two. The buddy allocator uses this structure to manage
  free memory efficiently. When allocating, it tries to find the smallest
  sufficient block, if the smallest sufficient block is larger than the
  requested size, it will be recursively split into the next smaller blocks
  until the required size is reached. When a page is freed, it may be merged
  with its buddy to form a larger block. It is initialized by
  ``zone_init_free_lists()``.
