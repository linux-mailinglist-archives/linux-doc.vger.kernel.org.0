I guess you mean besides listing five options and posting patches for two
of them :-)  We can't force semantics onto Zicclsm and I doubt we'll get
agreement to make another extension with the semantics we want. So (4)
is out. I agree with Clement that (5) isn't good. That leaves (2). I
guess we should start by trying to understand what issues there were/are
with it.
