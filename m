(Sorry for the somewhat delayed response... spent some time actually
writing what this would look like.)

I see what you mean, thanks! So has_fast_aging might be set by KVM if
the architecture sets a Kconfig saying that it understands the concept
of fast aging, basically what the presence of this v5's
test_clear_young_fast_only() indicates.

I just meant `kvm_has_shadow_mmu_sptes()` or
`kvm_memslots_have_rmaps()`. I like the logic you suggest below. :)

So just to be clear, for test_young(), I intend to have a patch in v6
to elide the shadow MMU check if the TDP MMU indicates Accessed. Seems
like a pure win; no reason not to include it if we're making logic
changes here anyway.

The most straightforward way (IMHO) to return something like `1 |
MMU_NOTIFY_WAS_FAST` up to the MMU notifier itself is to make
gfn_handler_t return int instead of bool.

In this v5, I worked around this need by using `bool *failed` in patch
5[1]. I think the way this is going to look now in v6 would be cleaner
by actually changing gfn_handler_t to return int, and then we can
write something like what you wrote here. What do you think?

Oh, yeah, that's a lot more intelligent than what I had. I think I
fully understand your suggestion; I guess we'll see in v6. :)

I wonder if this still makes sense if whether or not an MMU is "fast"
is determined by how contended some lock(s) are at the time. I think
it does, but I guess we can discuss more if it turns out that having
an architecture participate like this is actually something we want to
do (i.e., that performance results say it's a good idea).

Thanks Sean!
