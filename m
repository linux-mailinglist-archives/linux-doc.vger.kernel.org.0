Looks like we should add it. The "branches" cap seems to imply that any 
of the branch recording options are supported.

For --call-graph=lbr, that's a special branch type 
PERF_SAMPLE_BRANCH_CALL_STACK which we reject as not supported in BRBE. 
The test already does an additional skip if --call-graph=lbr isn't 
supported over the top of checking the branches cap. But there are other 
sub tests that don't use that option that should pass. They are only 
checking for non zero branch stack entries.

Any return type is fine really, as long as you can potentially make 
sense of it in the end.

I would say include everything that's already filling the buffer and can 
affect the program flow, even if they have to map to unknown or some 
slightly off mapping. These tools are supposed to increase visibility, 
not hide it. If silicon and buffer space are being consumed by branches, 
let userspace decide if it wants to do anything with them or not. It 
doesn't sound like changing 'unknown' to a more specific type in the 
future would be a breaking change.

Except for any security stuff of course, if FIQ is an issue because of 
that, filter it out.

I suppose you could say any branches that leave and return to the same 
place in userspace aren't useful, like trap and eret (but isn't syscall 
the same, and we have those?). But that's only if you filter out kernel. 
With both enabled the trap actually goes somewhere and I'm sure that's 
interesting to someone.

It might be fine to say that the types that we have now don't match up 
well enough, so we can revisit this in the future and add them in with 
the right types rather than a potentially breaking change from unknown. 
I will leave it to you.

I was mainly stuck on the permissions issue which seemed like a blocker. 
I noticed this one because the test was actually testing it, but you're 
right these more obscure branch types in userspace aren't exactly the 
MVP of BRBE.

Although I will say that leaving the associated ERETs in but filtering 
out the thing that took it there is a bit odd. Maybe that's just a 
personal thing without much technical merit.

A lot of words to say I don't really know for sure either.
