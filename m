OK, some notes...

I wish you'd done this against docs-next, that would have saved me
resolving a few conflicts on the MAINTAINERS file.

I thought we'd agreed to move this to the process book?  That said, I now
wonder about that...today I read the document as information for
maintainers on how to create their profile, so its location in the
maintainers manual is appropriate.

There were a number RST issues and warnings that I fixed up with the
following add-on patch; it was mostly a matter of adding blank lines where
needed.

One other warning resulted from the nvdimm profile document not being
linked into the TOC tree.  I've added a TOC section to the new document to
bring these things together for now.  This is almost certainly not what we
want in the longer term.

It was tempting to ask for this stuff to be fixed up, but I didn't want to
delay this work any longer.  So it's applied to docs-next; unless something
explodes in the very near future, I intend to push this for 5.5.

Thanks,

jon

Subject: [PATCH 2/2] docs: fix up the maintainer profile document

Add blank lines where needed to get the document to render properly.  Also
add a TOC of existing profiles just so that the nvdimm profile is linked
into the toctree, is discoverable, and doesn't generate a warning.
