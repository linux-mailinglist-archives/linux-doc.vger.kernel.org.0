I had a look through it, and I don't see anything that looks like it'll
clash with the folio patches.  The folio work really touches the page
cache for now, and this seems mostly to touch the devmap paths.

It would be nice to convert the devmap code to folios too, but that
can wait.  The mess with page refcounts needs to be sorted out first.
