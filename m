Yes, that is the difference. You cannot tell them apart otherwise.

I get the idea that technically, swap is its own memory region, but
evicted is counting memory that panthor knows is currently evicted,
not necessarily memory that is in swap. Counting pages that would
*actually* be in swap would probably involve breaking several
abstractions that shouldn't be broken.

Sure, we can make this definition as loose as you need it to be to use
it in a different driver. I think the difference between "not in a
preferred placement" and "no current placement (but had a placement in
the past)" is not a big one for the users of this information; the goal
is to see how much of the GPU memory of a process has been made non-
resident by a shrinker.

Panthor itself doesn't really know whether something is in swap or
has just been made non-resident by the drm shrinker. It could be
somewhere between swap and resident, as Steven Price pointed out.

"drm-evicted-vram" is only redundant to "total - resident" if objects
that have never been packed by any pages aren't counted in total. This
is not the case, so I'm trying to fix it by adding evicted to it for
pages that were backed at some stage, but now aren't backed anymore.

I think "evicted" solves this problem generally in your second example,
without me having to worry about whether a page is in swap or AMD's
memory model.

So, to summarise:
- Panthor does not know how much of the memory that was reclaimed by the
  shrinker is actually in swap space, so "drm-total-swap" wouldn't work
  here.
- "total - resident" measures the wrong thing. Objects that have never
  been backed are not evicted.
- I am completely fine with AMD not using this fdinfo memory type due
  to having more complex eviction handling, but I don't see why it
  could not be used in this form.
