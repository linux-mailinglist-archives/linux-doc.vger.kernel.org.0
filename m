We have, it's called drivers/gpu. Feel free to rename to drivers/xpu or
think G as in General, not Graphisc.

We also had this entire discussion 2 years ago with habanalabs. The
hang-up is that drivers/gpu folks require fully open source userspace,
including compiler and anything else you need to actually use the chip.
Greg doesn't, he's happy if all he has is the runtime library with some
tests.

These two drivers here look a lot more like classic gpus than habanalabs
did, at least from a quick look they operate with explicit buffer
allocations/registration model. So even more reasons to just reuse all the
stuff we have already. But also I don't expect these drivers here to come
with open compilers, they never do, not initially at least before you
started talking with the vendor. Hence I expect there'll be more
drivers/totally-not-drm acceleration subsystem nonsense.

Anyway this horse has been throughroughly beaten to death and more, the
agreement is that accel drivers in drivers/misc must not use any gpu
stuff, so that drivers/gpu people dont end up in a prickly situation they
never signed up for. E.g. I removed some code sharing from habanalabs.
This means interop between gpu and nn/ai drivers will be no-go until this
is resolved, but *shrug*.

Cheers, Daniel
