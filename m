The senpai plugin of oomd actually is a proactive reclaimer, so oomd
is being used for more than oom-killing.

There is no explicit knob but there are indirect ways to delay the
kernel oom killer. In the presence of reclaimable memory the kernel is
very conservative to trigger the oom-kill. I think the way Facebook is
achieving this in oomd is by using swap to have good enough
reclaimable memory and then using memory.swap.high to throttle the
workload's allocation rates which will increase the PSI as well. Since
oomd pools PSI, it will be able to react before the kernel oom-killer.
