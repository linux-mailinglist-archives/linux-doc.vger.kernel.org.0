Hi Eiichi,

I agree with Michal's points, and I think there are also some other design 
questions which don't quite make sense to me. Perhaps you can clear them up?  
:-)

The immediate red flag to me is that we're investing further mm knowledge into 
hugetlb. For the vast majority of intents and purposes, hugetlb exists outside 
of the typical memory management lifecycle, and historic behaviour has been to 
treat a separate reserve that we don't touch. We expect that hugetlb is a 
reserve which is by and large explicitly managed by the system administrator, 
not by us, and this seems to violate that.

Shoehorning in shrink-on-OOM support to it seems a little suspicious to me, 
because we already have a modernised system for huge pages that handles not 
only this, but many other memory management situations: THP. THP not only has 
support for this particular case, but so many other features which are 
necessary to coherently manage it as part of the mm lifecycle. For that reason, 
I'm not convinced that those composes to a sensible interface.

As some example questions which appear unresolved to me: if hugetlb pages are 
lost, what mechanisms will we provide to tell automation or the system 
administrator what to do in that scenario? How should the interface for 
resolving hugepage starvation due to repeated OOMs look? By what metrics will 
you decide if releasing the hugepage is worse for the system than selecting a 
victim for OOM? Why can't the system use the existing THP mechanisms to resolve 
this ahead of time?

Thanks,

Chris
