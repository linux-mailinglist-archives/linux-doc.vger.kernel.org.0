Thanks for including me in the discussion.

Right, we are seeing similar problems on our server too. To workaround
it we force an age iteration before reclaiming when it happens, which
isn't the best choice. When the LRU is long and the opposite type of
the folios we want to reclaim is piling up in the oldest gen, a forced
age will have to move all these folios, which leads to long tailing
issues. Let's work on a reasonable solution for that.

Agree, Thanks!
