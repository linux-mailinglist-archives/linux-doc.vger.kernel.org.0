And the PMU is an IP for recording events per CPU, but that is not
perf (only)...

The driver doesn't have enough information. If it is told to schedule
event A, it doesn't know anything about event B. It could in theory
try to remember event B if event B had already been scheduled, but it
never knows when event B is gone.

Keep in mind that there's only 64 branches recorded at most. How many
branches in a context switch plus reconfiguring the PMU? Not a small
percentage of 64 I think. In traces where freeze on overflow was not
working (there's an example in v18), just the interrupt entry until
BRBE was stopped was a significant part of the trace. A context switch
is going to be similar.

We can't really not record during a blackout period. The only way we
can is with freeze on overflow.

There's the same risk if something else is recording kernel branches
when you are recording userspace only. I think the user has to be
aware if other things like context switches are perturbing their data.
