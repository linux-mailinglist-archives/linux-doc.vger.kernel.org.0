So it actually looks like we just screwed up the original version of 
this: the reason we went with the more complicated address splits were 
than we actually started with a defacto 39-bit page table uABI (ie 
38-bit user VAs), and moving to even 48-bit page tables (ie, 47-bit user 
VAs) broke users (here's an ASAN bug, for example: 
https://github.com/google/android-riscv64/issues/64).  

Unless I'm missing something, though, the code doesn't actually do that.  
I remember having that discussion at some point, but I must have 
forgotten to make sure it worked.  As far as I can tell we've just moved 
to the 48-bit VAs by default, which breaks the whole point of doing the 
compatibilty stuff.  Probably a good sign I need to pay more attention 
to this stuff.

So I'm not really sure what to do here: we can just copy the arm64 
behavior at tell the other users that's just how things work, but then 
we're just pushing around breakages.  At a certain point all we can 
really do with this hint stuff is push around problems, though, and at 
least if we copy arm64 then most of those problems get reported as bugs 
for us.
