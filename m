Forgot to translate this? ;-)

Also it's probably more idiomatic to use the "Linux/LoongArch" 
convention throughout, as can be seen from similar previous usages such 
as "Linux/Alpha", "Linux/IA64", "Linux/PA-RISC" or "Linux/MIPS". (Of 
course it's "RISC-V Linux" according to my grep result but it's probably 
better to stick to traditions here IMO.)

Perhaps "... includes the memmap, the initrd, the command line, 
optionally the FDT, and so on." could be better?

The "on LoongArch machines" seems redundant, we're a LoongArch document 
so it's kinda implied information. Also drop "valid" as it's quite 
obvious too.

And it's not the bootloader that provides the kernel with those 3 
arguments, kernel_entry isn't directly called by firmware but rather by 
the EFI stub. And I doubt the FDT boot flow invokes kernel_entry either. 
Let's clarify things then, make the whole paragraph something like this:

"The kernel is passed the following arguments on `kernel_entry`::"

Please use a list for enumerating the 3 arguments.

Also the list belongs to the previous sentence, so you shouldn't start 
this paragraph with "where" but rather please use a new sentence. And 
the fact that a0 is a flag indicating whether full UEFI capabilities are 
present needs mentioning too.

"`efi_boot` is a flag indicating whether this boot environment is fully 
UEFI-compliant. `cmdline` is a pointer to the kernel command line. 
`systemtable` points to the EFI system table. All pointers involved at 
this stage are in physical addresses."

Everything becomes crystal clear when you somehow indicate it's just the 
DOS header of the EFI stub. Also AFAIK no LoongArch bootloader 
decompress the kernel image themselves, so it's not like there exists 
any "compressed Linux kernel image".

"Linux/LoongArch kernel images are EFI images. Being PE files, they have 
a 64-byte header structured like::"

No need for a new section: the rest are all explanations to the

Needs more background information, and (IMO) unnatural topicalization.

"LoongArch has abolished the use of a magic number for identifying the 
boot image as one for the LoongArch, because ..."

Right now, unfortunately I don't have enough time for providing all the 
details for the justification of removal of magic number, but you can 
refer to previous (long) threads where the earlier versions of the arch 
EFI boot code were reviewed. Pay attention especially to ardb's very 
detailed and in-depth explanation, you want to "transplant" the info here.

This is repeating the structure described above, only in a pictorial 
form. I think only one needs to be kept.

The boot loader probably doesn't care. GRUB2 just chain-loads after 
recognizing the image as valid EFI application, and the firmware most 
certainly just do its routine EFI application launch too without looking 
at the contents here that are all in fact just reserved space. (IIUC 
only the MZ signature and the PE header offset matter here; everything 
in between is actually part of the DOS stub which is ignored on all 
modern platforms.)

So, please clarify which component requires this info; is it the EFI 
stub instead? (I haven't checked myself though due to limited review 
time. Sorry for that.)

Drop explanation for trivial things like MZ or the PE header offset, 
they're just common PE format thing, and totally unrelated to Linux.
