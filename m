Actually, I rely on what you said in a previous mail when I say it's, 
potentially, not specific to nouveau.

<cite>
This sounds similar to what AMD hw used to have up until gfx8 (I think), 
basically sparse resources where defined through a separate mechanism to 
the address resolution of the page tables. I won't rule out that other 
hardware has similar approaches.

Optionally having regions is *not* a hardware specific concept, drivers 
might use it for a hardware specific purpose though. Which potentially 
is is the case for almost every DRM helper.

Drivers can use regions only for the sake of not merging between buffer 
boundaries as well. Some drivers might prefer this over "never merge" or 
"always merge", depending on the cost of re-organizing page tables for 
unnecessary splits/merges, without having the need of tracking separate 
sparse page tables.

Its just that I think *if* a driver needs to track separate sparse page 
tables anyways its a nice synergy since then there is no extra cost for 
getting this optimization.

Admittedly, I don't know what problems you are referring to. However, I 
don't see which kind of trouble it could cause by allowing drivers to 
track regions optionally.
