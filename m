As far as I understand, all the above arguments would also be addressed
with either a free-formed mention of LLM usage, or a formal
"non-advertising" tag that is not merged in the kernel history, right ?

For those two I suppose a machine-parseable tag in the git history could
improve things slightly compared to information provided in the patch
submission that would not get recorded in the history.

Is this why you have a preference for a formal tag compared to a
free-formed mention ?

I really think we need to have the information at submission. I think I
have a slight preference for not recording it in the kernel tree, but
only slight.
