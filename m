Hi SJ,

   Sorry for the delayed reply. Was away for a couple of days.
This resolves the layering question for me.

This RFC's IBS backend does not claim exclusive use of IBS.

The reason patch 7 ships as tristate is precedent and reuse: Bharata's
pghot v5 posted its IBS driver as a module, and I matched that shape
during development so the two consumers could potentially share IBS
plumbing instead of duplicating it.  Patches 1 and 2 exist to support
loadable ops modules generally.

More clarity on the right shape may emerge once Bharata comments on
the questions below.  If pghot ends up being the sole in-tree consumer
of legacy IBS Op, the loadable-ops question can be deferred to whenever
a second primitive actually needs it - patches 1 and 2 dropped, patch 7
made obj=3Dy or folded.  If both pghot and DAMON consume IBS, the
modular shape earns its keep.

Bharata - can you please weigh in on the long-term home for legacy IBS
Op (under pghot alongside IBS-MProf [pghot-v7] vs DAMON-side backend).
Related: any thoughts on the operator-facing knob to pick between
consumers when both are present?  Happy to align.

Thanks,
Ravi
