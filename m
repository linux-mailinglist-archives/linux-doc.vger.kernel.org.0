Add some advice on how to handle regressions as developer, reviewer, and
maintainer, as resolving regression without unnecessary delays requires
multiple people working hand in hand.

This removes equivalent paragraphs from a section in
Documentation/process/handling-regressions.rst, which will become mostly
obsolete through this and follow-up changes.
