Yeah, that was just a quick hack to prove the point. Perhaps Miguel can
provide the proper patch? ;)

I *think* the references like above (when done properly) are local to
the file. It's the labels that perhaps need this.

Sphinx also has some i18n support which I believe we aren't using, and
it would stand to reason this is covered there. But that probably needs
some dedication from Someone(tm) to figure out.
