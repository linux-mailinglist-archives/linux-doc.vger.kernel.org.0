Yes, probably.. (say probably because those cases are hidden and not
clear sometimes)

Sometimes the bug can not be easily reproduced again. So there seems
no easy and good way to use..

I would vote for PANIC_ON(), it sounds like a good idea, because
BUG_ON() is not obvious and, PANIC_ON() can alert the code author that
this will cause a kernel panic and one will be more careful before
using it.

Well, I'm not sure how to answer the questions,  when to panic should
be decided by kernel developers instead of kdump users,  but I think
the panic behaviour does impact the supporting team.  I added Stephen
who is from the RH supporting team, maybe he can have some inputs.

BTW, I vaguely remember Prarit introduced the panic_on_warn, see if he
has any comments here.

Thanks
Dave
