Yes but let's not forget the minority of humble humans still sending
honest reports ;-)

Sure. I'm just unsure where this could be enumerated, as it's likely
that there would be just one or two lines max per subsystem for the
majority of them. Or we could have a totally separate file, "threat
model", that goes into great lengths detailing all this with sections
per category or subsystem when they start to grow maybe, and refer only
to that one from security-bugs ?

OK but does this mean you still want to get these reports in the end ?
