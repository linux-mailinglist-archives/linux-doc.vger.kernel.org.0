Stefan, can you do me a favor and investigate which pages we end up 
deduplicating -- especially if it's mostly only the zeropage and if it's 
still that significant when disabling THP?


I'm currently investigating with some engineers on playing with enabling 
KSM on some selected processes (enabling it blindly on all VMAs of that 
process via madvise() ).

One thing we noticed is that such (~50 times) 20MiB processes end up 
saving ~2MiB of memory per process. That made me suspicious, because 
it's the THP size.

What I think happens is that we have a 2 MiB area (stack?) and only 
touch a single page. We get a whole 2 MiB THP populated. Most of that 
THP is zeroes.

KSM somehow ends up splitting that THP and deduplicates all resulting 
zeropages. Thus, we "save" 2 MiB. Actually, it's more like we no longer 
"waste" 2 MiB. I think the processes with KSM have less (none) THP than 
the processes with THP enabled, but I only took a look at a sample of 
the process' smaps so far.

I recall that there was a proposal to split underutilized THP and free 
up the zeropages (IIRC Rik was involved).

I also recall that Mike reported memory waste due to THP.
