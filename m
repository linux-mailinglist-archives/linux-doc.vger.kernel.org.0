Thanks!  I've got a small collection of doc fixup patches redy to go;
I'm going to spray them at maintainers and see what lands in this
merge window.  I'm focusing on mm/ and fs/ since I know those areas
better than others.  net/ is in good shape; only 25 lines of errors
(21 of them in ceph).

I would suggest that we still have quite a lot of kernel-doc which is
not incorporated into .rst files, which seems like a shame.  Does anyone
have time to write a script that finds every file with kernel-doc in
it, then finds which of those files do not have ".. kernel-doc::"
lines in Documentation/ ?
