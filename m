I forgot one, which was v1 of this series and already rejected,

 6. Use ID registers
    pro: None of the above cons, including the main con with the command
         line, which is that there could be many other decisions in the
	 future, implying we could need many more command line options.
    con: A slippery slope. We don't want to open the door to
         features-by-idregs. (However, we can at least always close the
	 door again if better mechanisms become available. Command
	 lines would need to be deprecated, but feature-by-idreg code
	 can just be deleted.)
