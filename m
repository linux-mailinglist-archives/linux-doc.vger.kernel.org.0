Hi Jani, thanks for your comments.

You're right. Initially I had all the :functions: statements separate because I
intended to have the function references interspersed between the document
paragraphs, but since I finally decided to put them all at the bottom it'd be
better to group them as much as possible.

Regarding the varargs doc, I'm getting no warnings. At first I included the @...
for every function and then I noticed some other existing cases where they were
automatically generated even though they weren't explicitly documented, so I
though that was the way to go.

But now that you mention it, there's this in Documentation/doc-guide/kernel-
doc.rst:

    If a function has a variable number of arguments, its description should
    be written in kernel-doc notation as::

          * @...: description

so I'll go ahead and add them.

Best,
Ricardo
