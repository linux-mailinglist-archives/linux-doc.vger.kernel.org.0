Add a documentation file Documentation/crypto/libcrypto.rst which
provides a high-level overview of lib/crypto/.

Also add several sub-pages which include the kerneldoc for the
algorithms that have it.  This makes the existing, quite extensive
kerneldoc start being included in the HTML documentation.

Note that the intent is very much *not* that everyone has to read these
Documentation/ files.  The library is intended to be straightforward and
use familiar conventions; generally it should be possible to dive right
into the kerneldoc.  You shouldn't need to read a lot of documentation
to just call `sha256()`, for example, or to run the unit tests if you're
already familiar with KUnit.  (This differs from the traditional crypto
API which has a larger barrier to entry.)

Nevertheless, this seems worth adding.  Hopefully it is useful and makes
LWN no longer consider the library to be "meticulously undocumented".

+Crypto library
+==============
+
+``lib/crypto/`` provides faster and easier access to cryptographic algorithms
+than the traditional crypto API.
+
+Each cryptographic algorithm is supported via a set of dedicated functions.
+"Crypto agility", where needed, is left to calling code.
+
+The crypto library functions are intended to be boring and straightforward, and
+to follow familiar conventions.  Their primary documentation is their (fairly
+extensive) kerneldoc.  This page just provides some extra high-level context.
+
+Note that the crypto library is not entirely new.  ``lib/`` has contained some
+crypto functions since 2005.  Rather, it's just an approach that's been expanded
+over time as it's been found to work well.  It also largely just matches how the
+kernel already does things elsewhere.
+
+Scope and intended audience
+===========================
+
+The crypto library documentation is primarily meant for kernel developers who
+need to use a particular cryptographic algorithm(s) in kernel code.  For
+example, "I just need to compute a SHA-256 hash."  A secondary audience is
+developers working on the crypto algorithm implementations themselves.
+
+If you're looking for more general information about cryptography, like the
+differences between the different crypto algorithms or how to select an
+appropriate algorithm, you should refer to external sources which cover that
+type of information much more comprehensively.  If you need help selecting
+algorithms for a new kernel feature that doesn't already have its algorithms
+predefined, please reach out to ``linux-crypto@vger.kernel.org`` for advice.
+
+Code organization
+=================
+
+- ``lib/crypto/*.c``: the crypto algorithm implementations
+
+- ``lib/crypto/$(SRCARCH)/``: architecture-specific code for crypto algorithms.
+  It is here rather than somewhere in ``arch/`` partly because this allows
+  generic and architecture-optimized code to be easily built into a single
+  loadable module (when the algorithm is set to 'm' in the kconfig).
+
+- ``lib/crypto/tests/``: KUnit tests for the crypto algorithms
+
+- ``include/crypto/``: crypto headers, both for the crypto library and the
+  traditional crypto API
+
+Generally, there is one kernel module per algorithm.  Sometimes related
+algorithms are grouped into one module.  There is intentionally no common
+framework, though there are some utility functions that multiple algorithms use.
+
+Each algorithm module is controlled by a tristate kconfig symbol
+``CRYPTO_LIB_$(ALGORITHM)``.  As is the norm for library functions in the
+kernel, these are hidden symbols which don't show up in the kconfig menu.
+Instead, they are just selected by all the kconfig symbols that need them.
+
+Many of the algorithms have multiple implementations: a generic implementation
+and architecture-optimized implementation(s).  Each module initialization
+function, or initcall in the built-in case, automatically enables the best
+implementation based on the available CPU features.
+
+Note that the crypto library doesn't use the ``crypto/``,
+``arch/$(SRCARCH)/crypto/``, or ``drivers/crypto/`` directories.  These
+directories are used by the traditional crypto API.  When possible, algorithms
+in the traditional crypto API are implemented by calls into the library.
+
+Advantages
+==========
+
+Some of the advantages of the library over the traditional crypto API are:
+
+- The library functions tend to be much easier to use.  For example, a hash
+  value can be computed using only a single function call.
+
+- The library functions are usually faster, especially for short inputs.  They
+  call the crypto algorithms directly without inefficient indirect calls, memory
+  allocations, string parsing, lookups in an algorithm registry, and other
+  unnecessary API overhead.  Architecture-optimized code is enabled by default.
+
+- Most of the library functions return void and never fail.  Thus, in most cases
+  callers don't need to handle errors.
+
+- Most of the library functions operate on standard virtual addresses, rather
+  than scatterlists which are difficult and less efficient to work with.
+
+- The library functions use standard link-time dependencies instead of
+  error-prone dynamic loading by name.
+
+- The library focuses on the approach that works the best on the vast majority
+  of systems: CPU-based implementations of the crypto algorithms, utilizing
+  on-CPU acceleration (such as AES instructions) when available.
+
+- The library uses standard KUnit tests, rather than custom ad-hoc tests.
+
+- The library tends to have higher assurance implementations of the crypto
+  algorithms.  This is both due to its simpler design and because more of its
+  code is being regularly tested.
+
+- The library supports features that don't fit into the rigid framework of the
+  traditional crypto API, for example interleaved hashing and XOFs.
+
+When to use it
+==============
+
+In-kernel users should use the library (rather than the traditional crypto API)
+whenever possible.  Many subsystems have already been converted.  It usually
+simplifies their code significantly and improves performance.
+
+Some kernel features allow userspace to provide an arbitrary string that selects
+an arbitrary algorithm from the traditional crypto API by name.  These features
+generally will have to keep using the traditional crypto API for backwards
+compatibility.
+
+Note: new kernel features should not support every algorithm, but rather make a
+deliberate choice about what algorithm(s) to support.  History has shown that
+making a deliberate, thoughtful choice greatly simplifies code maintenance,
+reduces the chance for mistakes (such as using an obsolete, insecure, or
+inappropriate algorithm), and makes your feature easier to use.
+
+Testing
+=======
+
+The crypto library uses standard KUnit tests.  Like many of the kernel's other
+KUnit tests, they are included in the set of tests that are run by
+``tools/testing/kunit/kunit.py run --alltests``.
+
+A ``.kunitconfig`` file is also provided to run just the crypto library tests.
+For example, here's how to run them in user-mode Linux:
+
+.. code-block::
+
+    tools/testing/kunit/kunit.py run --kunitconfig=lib/crypto/
+
+Many of the crypto algorithms have architecture-optimized implementations.
+Testing those requires building an appropriate kernel and running the tests
+either in QEMU or on appropriate hardware.  Here's one example with QEMU:
+
+.. code-block::
+
+    tools/testing/kunit/kunit.py run --kunitconfig=lib/crypto/ --arch=arm64 --make_options LLVM=1
+
+Depending on the code being tested, flags may need to be provided to QEMU to
+emulate the correct type of hardware for the code to be reached.
+
+Since correctness is essential in cryptographic code, new architecture-optimized
+code is accepted only if it can be tested in QEMU.
+
+Note: the crypto library also includes FIPS 140 self-tests.  These are
+lightweight, are designed specifically to meet FIPS 140 requirements, and exist
+*only* to meet those requirements.  Normal testing done by kernel developers and
+integrators should use the much more comprehensive KUnit tests instead.
