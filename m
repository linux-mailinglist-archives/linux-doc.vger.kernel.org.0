This patch fixes file references from txt to rst file ending in
ww-mutex-design.rst and futex-requeue-pi.rst. While on it fix a spelling
issue "desgin" to "design" reported by Matthew Wilcox.

Maybe there are more somewhere else in Documentation? However I caught
these ones in locking.

changes since v2:
 - spell fix from "desgin" to "design".
