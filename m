Yeah, I am also not a particular fan of fake-head detection code, and 
how this hugetlb monstrosity affects our implementation of compound 
pages. :)

Moving from compound_head -> compound_info sounds like a suboptimal 
temporary step, though, as we want compound_head to to point at "struct 
folio" etc soon (either allocated separately or an overlay of "struct 
page", based on a config option). So operating on vmemmap addresses is 
not what the new world will look like.

Of course, we could lookup the head page first and then use the memdesc 
pointer in there to get our "struct folio", but it will be one 
unnecessary roundtrip through the head page.

I'm sure Willy has an opinion on this. but likely has other priorities 
given we are in the merge window and LPC is coming up.
