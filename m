NAK because clearly AI slop, again.

(side note - 'page' reclaim is a misnomer now, we should just call this doc
reclaim - we reclaim folios not pages :)

Anway, again, you've not bothered finding out who maintains reclaim, I just
looked and it took me 10 seconds:

MEMORY MANAGEMENT - RECLAIM
M:	Andrew Morton <akpm@linux-foundation.org>
M:	Johannes Weiner <hannes@cmpxchg.org>
R:	David Hildenbrand <david@kernel.org> <- by chance you have David :)
R:	Michal Hocko <mhocko@kernel.org>
R:	Qi Zheng <zhengqi.arch@bytedance.com>
R:	Shakeel Butt <shakeel.butt@linux.dev>
R:	Lorenzo Stoakes <ljs@kernel.org>
L:	linux-mm@kvack.org
S:	Maintained
F:	mm/vmscan.c
F:	mm/workingset.c

You've not even done that, let alone thought to cc- anybody on that list, 5
minutes glancing over the mailing list would tell you this is is common
courtesy.

The documentation is useless hand-waving that maintainers would have to
essentially rewrite for you on 'review'.

This is not a good use of maintainer time, and we don't want stuff we could
generate ourselves.

You've also, again, used a copy/paste meaningless, worthless commit message - 5
minutes glacing through the linux-mm list would tell you what we expect.

I mean I say 'you', this was Claude surely?

Yeah let's not bother discuss what clean or dirty means, or why that matters, or
anything useful...
