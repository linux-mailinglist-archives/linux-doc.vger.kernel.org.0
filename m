After thinking about this a lot, and talking it over with Danilo a bit,
I've applied this series that reverts these changes.

Kernel developers / maintainers are only "allowed" one major argument /
fight a year, and I really don't want to burn my 2026 usage so early in
the year :)

Tzung-Bi, can you take the feedback here, and what you have learned from
the gpio patch series, and rework this into a "clean" patch series for
us to review and comment on for future releases?  That should give us
all a baseline on which to work off of, without having to worry about
the different versions/fixes floating around at the moment.

thanks,

greg k-h
