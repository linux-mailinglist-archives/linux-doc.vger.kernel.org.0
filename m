My point is just I read 'kernel enters at EL1' as meaning the kernel
booted at EL1 and EL2 is not accessible. Maybe should reworded as
'before/if the kernel drops to EL1'

That's the tradeoff. I'll defer to others whether a single id register
read here is preferred.

Probably and there's a Jira for it. Though there was some debate about
whether anything was needed before any users. But that's kind of a
mute point anyway because I need it for PMU now, too.

Yes, as it needs to not be held up by any of the debug issues Mark
raised. Also, it may need to be back ported to 6.12. And for that we'd
want the PMU parts, but not the Debug. I still have to figure out what
needs to be done on the KVM side.
