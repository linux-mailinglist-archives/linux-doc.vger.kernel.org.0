in vmcoreinfo

Hello Bhupesh,
V6 patch set on Linux 5.7, did not help.
I have applied makedump file
http://lists.infradead.org/pipermail/kexec/2019-November/023963.html changes
also (makedump-1.6.6). Tried to apply it on makedumpfile 1.6.7.  Patch set_2
failed. Would like to know, if you have V5 patch set for makedump file
changes. With makedump 1.6.6, able to collect the vmore file.
I used latest crash utility
(https://www.redhat.com/archives/crash-utility/2019-November/msg00014.html
changes are present)
When I used crash utility, following is the error:

Thanks,
-Bharat
