Yeah, I think it's -stable material, but I'd like some bake time in
-next just in case. zplin saw that there was a 2 * sizeof(void *) case
that existed in the kernel that would trip over the issue.

#1 is entirely cosmetic. It should also be fine to put into -stable, but
since it had no operational impact, I figured it didn't need to be.

Unless I'm missing something big, yeah, that would be my preference too.
(And -stable can pick it up then.)
