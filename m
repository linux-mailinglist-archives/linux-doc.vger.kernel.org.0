What is the actual problem?

The documentation in booting.rst is accurate; I don't see why it's
necessary to read the source code to look at text_offset. Immediately
above the text in your diff, the documentation has:

| 4. Call the kernel image
| ------------------------
| 
| Requirement: MANDATORY
| 
| The decompressed kernel image contains a 64-byte header as follows::
| 
|   u32 code0;                    /* Executable code */
|   u32 code1;                    /* Executable code */
|   u64 text_offset;              /* Image load offset, little endian */
|   u64 image_size;               /* Effective Image size, little endian */
|   u64 flags;                    /* kernel flags, little endian */
|   u64 res2      = 0;            /* reserved */
|   u64 res3      = 0;            /* reserved */
|   u64 res4      = 0;            /* reserved */
|   u32 magic     = 0x644d5241;   /* Magic number, little endian, "ARM\x64" */
|   u32 res5;                     /* reserved (used for PE COFF offset) */

Can you explain the problem you're facing? e.g.

* Is the documentation unclear, in a way that could be better?

* Is there some aspect of the boot protocol that is hard for a
  bootloader to follow?

* Is there some problem with *testing* that bootloaders respect the
  text_offset requirements?

* Something else?

Keeping text_offset as a concept was deliberate. That allows us to keep
the documentation accruate for older kernel versions, and allows for the
possiblity that a non-zero offset is introduced in future (though I
admit that might be a tough sell).

So far we've tried to ensure that the documentation covers current *and*
older kernel versions. If we're going to drop text covering older
versions we'd need an explciit statemnt as to which kernel versions the
document is accurate for.

I would prefer that we retained documentation regarding the text_offset
field in the header, even if it happens to be zero today.
