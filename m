True. I suppose you could argue that it should have been
pidfd_madvise() then for consistency, but that ship has sailed.

The use case for a potential pidfd_mbind() is basically a combination
of what is described for in the process_madvise proposal (
https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20200901000633.1920247-1-minchan@kernel.org/
), and what this proposal describes: system management software acting
as an orchestrator that has a better overview of the system as a whole
(NUMA nodes, memory tiering), and has knowledge of the layout of the
processes involved.

pidfd_mbind()  makes sense to me, since the notion of an external
agent with knowledge of the VM layout is already there with
process_madvise(). And since set_mempolicy and mbind are closely
related, it would seem logical to add an mbind variant as well as
pidfd_set_mempolicy().

Having said that, I'm fine with leaving that discussion for another time.
