C will not allow catching as many things as compile time as rust, that's
for sure, but I don't think it's the main issue here. The core of the
problem, in my opinion, is that we have seen a proliferation of devres
and similar helpers that were quickly adopted by drivers as it made
their life easier, *but* without any documentation of the caveats and
correct usage patterns. We have APIs that don't tell how to use them
correctly, so we can hardly blame driver developers for not doing it
right. In many cases we haven't even thought about what the right (and
wrong) usage patterns are, and in some cases the APIs have been
developed with so little awareness of these issues that there's no
correct usage pattern. Fixing this is the first step, then we can see
how to use the features provided by the programming language to minimize
the risk of incorrect usage.
