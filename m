Not yet, but once we deploy in various production kernels, we expect
to find new bugs (we'll report back with results once deployed).
Especially in drivers or subsystems that syzkaller+KASAN can't touch,
e.g. where real devices are required to get coverage. We expect to
have first results on this within 3 months, and can start backports
now that KFENCE for mainline is being finalized. This will likely also
make it into Android, but deployment there will take much longer.

The story is similar with the user space version of the tool
(GWP-ASan), where results started to materialize once it was deployed
across the fleet.

Nothing obvious I think. KFENCE is unique in that it is meant for
production fleets of machines (with ~zero overhead and no new HW
features), with the caveat that due to it being sampling based, it's
not so suitable for single machine testing. The other debugging tools
are suitable for the latter, but not former.

Thanks,
