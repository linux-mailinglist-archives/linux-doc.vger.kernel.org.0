Thank you Will and Mark for meeting with me to discuss things in person.

Here's my main takeaways so the list can comment:

Will's initial idea doesn't work because there is no way for KVM to pin
counters in a way that takes priority over counters pinned by the host
and therefore guarantee reservation.

An alternate idea I am proposing is to call the perf core
sched_in/sched_out functionality during vcpu_load/vcpu_put when guest
counters need to be reserved/unreserved.

That means having perf vacate all the host counters temporarily,
modifying the arm_pmu.cntr_mask to add/remove the appropriate counters,
then having perf schedule all host events back on the new set. Perf is
capable of doing that without any significant changes.

This is simple and should work because arm_pmu.cntr_mask is already
accessible from the vcpu struct and modifying it is already how the
existing boot-time counter reservation works.

There are some tradeoffs to this approach that will need further
consideration. The first is how to handle event groups. Perf allows
events to be grouped such that they must all be scheduled in at once. If
the host has a larger group than the number of counters available while
the vcpu is loaded, then it simply won't be able to schedule that group
in for that time period. Another is whether it will be acceptable
performance-wise to put perf sched_in/sched_out in
vcpu_load/vcpu_put. I'm unsure how much delay that would add to those
paths.

Absent strong objections, I will be posting a series using this method.

Another idea that was not discussed that I had later is a middle
approach that is less dynamic but gives the user control over when the
perf sched_in/sched_out happens. Expose the existing boot-time parameter
as writable in sysfs and do the sched_out/modify mask/sched_in when that
is written rather than in vcpu_load.
