Oh, yes, good idea!

I think you, as the recognized leader of the doc project, can
establish some guiding principles on this, providing a bit of top-down
order. e.g. adopt a specific "Linux kernel documentation project mission
statement / strategy" that takes a distinctly opinionated stand on
anything that has been debated. For example, a strawman, not meant
to block this series in any way:

	Our primary audience is kernel developers, especially new
	contributors. Our next priority is people who want to engage
	with the developer community, but may not strictly be kernel
	developers (e.g. testers, bug reporters, researchers, press,
	etc). Next is users of the kernel, especially for how to use
	various features or configurations.

	Topics are ordered from least complexity to greatest complexity,
	with ties solved alphabetically.

	Links to development conversations must use Lore URLs unless
	they are specifically not available.

	Links to external documentation is strongly encouraged. Any
	dead links will be removed if not updated within 6 months.

	The "htmldocs" build target is expected to build without
	warnings.

It could live in Documentation/doc-guide/contributing.rst, and be the
tie-break for anything that comes up. Obviously, it, too, could change.

Ship it! "Patches welcome", etc. :)
