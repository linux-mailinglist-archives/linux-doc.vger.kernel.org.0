Right, that probably because of the lack of my previous patch
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/next/linux-next.git/commit/?id=fba67e8f897870403e1a4f5fe3835c870cd589e0
which hasn't finished its journey yet

I am not sure how to proceed as there are a few other patches for
various subsystems I am planning to send out (like deleting
RFCOMM_TTY_MAGIC from net/bluetooth/rfcomm/tty.c or GDTIOCTL_MAGIC
from drivers/scsi/gdth_ioctl.h) which will also be touching this file
and I'd rather not cause some merge problems...
Maybe I should not update the documentation in the patches removing
the constants from the code and clean it up separately?

Sure, I picked this file and initially started cleaning it up,
including deleting that changelog, but then decided to first clean up
the code referencing some of those constants without using them.
There are lots of other things to delete in this file, like references
to OSS and maybe even the file itself given that the practice of using
a magic field in structs is no longer common, but I can start sending
a few simple cleanups.
