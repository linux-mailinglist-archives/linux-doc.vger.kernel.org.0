Hello,

In short: a few weeks ago, I gained complete access to all the devices you =
use to browse the internet. Shortly after that, I started recording your en=
tire online activity.

Below is the sequence of events that led to this:
Some time ago, you accessed a link and had to verify it via reCAPTCHA to se=
e the content. In fact, this verification was fake, and after the verificat=
ion, a Trojan virus was actually installed on your device. From there, it w=
asn=E2=80=99t long until the virus was installed on all your devices, consi=
dering that you connect to the same network with all your devices. Don=E2=
=80=99t you believe me? Search the net for "Fake reCAPTCHA" and see for you=
rself.

With the help of this virus, I can now access all the components of your de=
vices (camera, microphone, keyboard). As a result, I was able to download a=
ll your photos, personal data, your browsing history, and other information=
 to my servers without any problem.

Moreover, now I have access to all your messaging accounts, social networks=
, emails, contact list, your conversation history, absolutely everything. M=
y virus continuously updates its signatures, so it remains undetected by an=
y antivirus software.

Considering that you got the virus from an adult site, at first I thought y=
ou were just an occasional visitor to these sites. But then I noticed that =
you take a crazy pleasure in satisfying yourself on very controversial mate=
rials, reaching intense orgasms.

To be honest with you: it was hard for me to resist, and I recorded many vi=
deos with you in those scenes and compiled special videos where I expose yo=
ur self-satisfaction sessions, plus the videos you watched during those act=
s and which end with your ejaculation =F0=9F=92=A6.

I could, at this moment, with just a few clicks, share these videos with yo=
ur friends, colleagues, and relatives. Also, I would have no qualms about u=
ploading this content online so that everyone can see what sick orientation=
s you have!

Honestly, I think you don=E2=80=99t want this to happen. This would complet=
ely ruin your reputation.

However, don=E2=80=99t worry, there is still a way to resolve the situation=
=2E You need to make a transfer of $1232 via Bitcoin. After you complete th=
e transaction, I will delete all the videos in which you appear =F0=9F=93=
=BA, all the personal data collected, and the virus from your devices. Mark=
 my words: I never lie.

This is a great deal at the lowest price, considering that I have wasted a =
lot of time and effort to record and track all your activities and your dee=
ds.
If you have no idea how to buy and transfer Bitcoin, feel free to search th=
e internet for the necessary information.

You can use the wallet address below to make the transfer:
bc1q gy0puzkkvkjwpu9xzzezkt322dcukh304l25jp

The address above, as you can see, has a blank space. When you use it to se=
nd the money, make sure you remove that space.

You only have 42 hours from now, and the timer started from the moment you =
opened this email.
You have to believe me: there is no point in bothering you anymore after I =
get the money.
Besides, if I really wanted to, all those videos would have been public a l=
ong time ago.
I think we can still resolve the situation on fair terms.
