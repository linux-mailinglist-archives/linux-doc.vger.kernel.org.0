Ok, after having a quick look at amdgpu, I can see what you mean.

The missing piece for me was that the BO+VM abstraction itself keeps a 
list of mappings for this specific BO and VM.

Just to make it obvious for other people following the discussion, let 
me quickly sketch up how this approach would look like for the GPUVA 
manager:

1. We would need a new structure to represent the BO+VM combination, 
something like:

	struct drm_gpuva_mgr_gem {
     		struct drm_gpuva_manager *mgr;
		struct drm_gem_object *obj;
		struct list_head gpuva_list;
	};

with a less horrible name, hopefully.

2. Create an instance of struct drm_gpuva_mgr_gem once a GEM becomes 
associated with a GPUVA manager (VM) and attach it to the GEMs, as by 
now, "gpuva" list.

In amdgpu, for example, this seems to be the case once a GEM object is 
opened, since there is one VM per file_priv.

However, for other drivers this could be different, hence drivers would 
need to take care about this.


3. Attach GPUVAs to the new gpuva_list of the corresponding instance of
struct drm_gpuva_mgr_gem.

4. Drivers would need to clean up the instance of struct 
drm_gpuva_mgr_gem, once the GEM is not associated with the GPUVA manager 
anymore.

As pointed out by Christian, this would optimize the "get all mappings 
backed by a specific BO from a given VM" use case.

The question for me is, do other drivers than amdgpu commonly need this?

And what does amdgpu need this for? Maybe amdgpu does something we're 
not doing (yet)?

Christian - I know you didn't ask for "do it the way amdgpu does", 
instead you voted for keeping it entirely driver specific. But I think 
everyone is pretty close and I'm still optimistic that we could just 
generalize this.
