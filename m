Yeah, this is what I meant with the "you must also ensure that a VMA
exists" part. (Context is that I was looking at some non-upstream code
that was trying to do exactly this - take a userspace-supplied address
and walk down the page tables at that address. Upstream also once had
a UAF in pagemap_walk() because walk_page_range() was used while
holding only the mmap read lock, see
<https://project-zero.issues.chromium.org/42451485>.)

I guess maybe we could replace this entire warning block with
something like this?

".. warning:: Page tables are normally only traversed in regions
covered by VMAs. If you want to traverse page tables in areas that
might not be covered by VMAs, heavier locking is required. See
:c:func:`!walk_page_range_novma` for details."

And walk_page_range_novma() already has a comment block talking about
why an mmap read lock isn't enough to traverse user virtual address
space outside VMAs.

(FWIW from a quick look I think only arm and x86 actually have this behavio=
r.)

I mean... we could try to just make userspace page tables live in
non-high-memory based on the assumption that nobody nowadays is going
to run a 32-bit kernel on a device with significantly more than 4G or
8G or so of RAM, and probably most memory is used for stuff like
anon/file pages, not for page tables... but I don't think it actually
matters much for code complexity now that we need RCU for page table
access anyway.

Yeah, and not just pte_offset_map_lock() but also pte_offset_map() and
such which don't lock the page table.

This is to protect against khugepaged/MADV_COLLAPSE deleting page
tables while holding only an rmap lock (in read mode), the pmd lock,
and the pte lock. So a concurrent call to MADV_COLLAPSE (potentially
in another process) can (via retract_page_tables()) remove the page
table while we're traversing it, but the page table will only actually
be freed via RCU (thanks to pte_free_defer), and so this doesn't cause
use-after-free. pte_offset_map_lock() ensures that on success, it has
locked the current page table (holding the pte lock prevents the page
table being removed in the future, and rechecking the pmd entry
ensures it hasn't already been removed), so we never end up installing
PTEs into page tables that have already been removed. pte_offset_map()
does not ensure that you always see the latest page table; it could be
that by the time you're looking at a PTE inside it, the page table
you're looking at has been removed, and a new page table has been
installed in its place and populated with PTEs. But removed page
tables are always empty, so the only possible consequence of such a
race is that you wrongly think that there is no PTE at a given
address.

The fourth paragraph of the comment block above
__pte_offset_map_lock() sorta explains this.
