The PCI core holds a reference to the incoming FLB for as long as it
maintains a pointer to that FLB in struct pci_dev
(dev->liveupdate.incoming). The lifetime of that pointer is aligned
with the lifetime of the file as long as the driver calls
pci_liveupdate_finish() in its file finish() callback.

If there is a bug in the driver that causes it to not call
pci_liveupdate_finish() then the FLB will leak past the file yes. But
the alternative would be to leak a pointer to freed memory in
dev->liveupdate.incoming, which could lead to UAF.

Leaking the FLB seems safer than UAF, which is why I went for the
refcounting approach.

Another approach entirely would be to drop the
dev->liveupdate.incoming and do the xarray lookup everytime instead.

We are only planning on supporting Live Update for VFIO drivers for
the forseeable future. The VFIO work during probe is almost entirely
software state setup. The only hardware logic we need to "if" out in
the vfio-pci driver's probe() is putting the device into a low-power
mode via the runtime power manager. So I don't think we will get any
benefit from this approach, and it would be a lot more intrusive to
both the PCI core driver framework, and VFIO itself, to support this.

You can find the vfio-pci driver changes here:

  https://lore.kernel.org/kvm/20260511234802.2280368-1-vipinsh@google.com/

Let's keep the discussion focused on upstream VFIO drivers since that
is all we are planning to support right now due to LUO's requirement
of file-based preservation. The downstream driver changes we are
carrying is not reflective of what we want to support upstream.

This is speculative. In practice, we haven't needed to change VFIO's
shutdown() or probe() functions so far. The only change I anticipate
needing is skipping runtime power management "put" during probe() I
mentioned above.

If we actually made retrieve() a first-class callback and used that
instead of probe(), VFIO would internally just call its probe()
function because that would be the cleanest way to set up all the
software state it needs to manage the device.

It's not so simple. The PCI core does not really initialize itself.
Scanning devices gets triggered externally, e.g. by ACPI, device
trees, runtime hotplug events, etc., and that is when the PCI core
gets notified about a device. None of this is synchronized with "when
drivers have registered", which I assume you are referring to
registering with LUO.
