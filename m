This doesn't really answer my questions above.

Two points here (and the reason why I am repeatedly asking for some
data) 1) are you really seeing shared and actively used page cache pages
being reclaimed? 2) Is the refault IO really a problem. What kind of
storage those phone have that this is more significant than potentially
GB of compressed anonymous memory which would need CPU to refaulted
back. I mean do you have any actual numbers to show that the default
reclaim strategy would lead to a less utilized or less performant
system?
