Agreed. I've posted v7 which includes kswapd profiles collected from an
arm64 v8.2 laptop under memory pressure.

No, it's from Snapdragon 7c. Please see the kswapd profiles in v7.

So NONLEAF_PMD_YOUNG at most can save 4% CPU usage from kswapd. But
this definitely can vary, depending on the workloads.

Yes.

It depends on the goal.

No.

A mandatory sync to disk must use the dirty bit to ensure data
integrity. But for a voluntary sync to disk, it can use the accessed
bit to narrow the search of dirty pages.

A mandatory sync is used to free specific dirty pages. A voluntary sync
is used to keep the number of dirty pages low in general and it doesn't
target any specific dirty pages.

The v7 has a switch to disable this feature on x86. If you can run your
workloads on x86, then it might be able to help you measure the difference.
