AFAICT amdgpu_prepare_job can allocate memory. Maybe that is okay 
because scheduler workqueue is nowadays marked as WQ_MEM_RECLAIM but in 
general it would be more logical if it wasn't allocating. It does not 
seem an easy job to make it stop doing so. Perhaps Christian has 
something planned here?

irrevocably

(Btw I did not do a full read, just came here for prepare_job 
clarifications.)
