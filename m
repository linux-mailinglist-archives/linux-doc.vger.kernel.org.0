It would be good to expand on the argument that Rik made about the
interpreter being used for things were there are no merging
opportunities, and the KSM scanning overhead isn't amortized.

There is a fundamental mismatch in scopes. madvise() is a
workload-local decision, whereas sizable sharing opportunities may or
may not exist across multiple workloads. Only a higher-level entity
like a job scheduler can know for certain whether it's running one or
more instances of a job. That job scheduler in turn doesn't have the
necessary knowledge of the workload's internals to make targeted and
well-timed advise calls with, say, process_madvise().

This also applies to the security concerns brought up in previous
threads. An individual workload doesn't know what else is running on
the machine, so it needs to be highly conservative about what it can
give up for system-wide merging. However, if the system is dedicated
to running multiple jobs within the same security domain, it's the job
scheduler that knows that sharing isn't a problem, and even desirable.

So I think this series makes sense, but it would be good to expand a
bit on the reasoning and address the security aspect in the cover/doc.

The implementation looks sound to me as well.

I think it would be a bit easier to review if you folded these ^^^
patches, the tools patch below, and the prctl selftests, all into one
single commit. It's one logical change. This way the new flags and
helper functions can be reviewed against the new users and callsites
without having to jump back and forth between emails.

Same with the new knobs/stats and their documentation.

Logical splitting is easier to follow than geographical splitting.

Thanks!
