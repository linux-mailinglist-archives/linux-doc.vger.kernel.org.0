Great visualization!

Nit: It seems to be actually the other way around:

 * 10 seconds pass
 * watchdog_hardlockup_check() called and notices touch and skips updating counters
 * 10 seconds pass
 * watchdog_hardlockup_check() called and saves counter (1001)

Fair enough.

Heh, I was not aware that "hrtimer_interrupts_missed" was added by
the 3rd patch. I looked at the final code with all patches applied ;-)

OK, this 1st patch moves "is_hardlockup()" up because it has some
"side effects". It adds a 4-line comment to explain it.
But it still causes problems in the 3rd patch.

A better solution might be to separate the check and update/reset
of the values. Something like (on top of this patchset, just
compilation tested):

Fair enough.

Sigh, it seems that touch_nmi_watchdog() can't be removed easily.
