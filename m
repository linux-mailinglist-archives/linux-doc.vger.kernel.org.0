With Sub-NUMA Cluster mode enabled the scope of monitoring resources is
per-NODE instead of per-L3 cache. Suffixes of directories with "L3" in
their name refer to Sub-NUMA nodes instead of L3 cache ids.

Users should be aware that SNC mode also affects the amount of L3 cache
available for allocation within each SNC node.

+Notes on Sub-NUMA Cluster mode
+==============================
+When SNC mode is enabled Linux may load balance tasks between Sub-NUMA
+nodes much more readily than between regular NUMA nodes since the CPUs
+on Sub-NUMA nodes share the same L3 cache and the system may report
+the NUMA distance between Sub-NUMA nodes with a lower value than used
+for regular NUMA nodes.  Users who do not bind tasks to the CPUs of a
+specific Sub-NUMA node must read the "llc_occupancy", "mbm_total_bytes",
+and "mbm_local_bytes" for all Sub-NUMA nodes where the tasks may execute
+to get the full view of traffic for which the tasks were the source.
+
+The cache allocation feature still provides the same number of
+bits in a mask to control allocation into the L3 cache. But each
+of those ways has its capacity reduced because the cache is divided
+between the SNC nodes. The values reported in the resctrl
+"size" files are adjusted accordingly.
