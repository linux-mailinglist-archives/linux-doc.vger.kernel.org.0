I had a reason for doing this, can't recall. I will revisit and remove
it which is ideal. I have to look at CONFIG_GENERIC_ATOMIC64 as well.

Not seeing any errors with my config which has CONFIG_64BIT=y

Thanks.

Still like seqnum_ops.

There is seqcount_t in seqlock.h which is a totally different feature.
