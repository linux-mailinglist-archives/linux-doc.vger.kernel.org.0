Hi,

Thanks for the explanations.

OK.

Yes, I understand that. And in general the patch is a good idea,
even though I observed that edge case.

Yes, I wasn't trying to suggest using underscore as a break character.

OK.

OK, sounds reasonable.

nah.

I see.

Sounds messy.

I see that Jon asked about provenance of these patches.
I meant to do that as well but got wrapped up in Advanced Search
testing.
