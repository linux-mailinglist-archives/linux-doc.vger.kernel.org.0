Existing project is very important. I believe that embedding libublksrv/UAPI
into existing projects(products) makes ublk more popular and useful.

Your are correct, Ming. ublksrv tgts does not need UBLK_IO_NEED_GET_DATA.

For existing projects using ublksrv, why it must use ublksrv's pre-allocated buffer?
The backend has its own buffer management.

Besides, existing projects may directly embed libublksrv/UAPI into it.
UBLK_IO_NEED_GET_DATA is just an option for them.

Ming, UBLK_IO_NEED_GET_DATA usecases has been proved useful and we have discussed
it when I introduced it into kernel driver. Really (1)users use ublksrv directly
or (2)developers implement new ublksrv targets do not have to care about it.

UBLK_IO_NEED_GET_DATA is an option. Any user thinks that it may lower performance
should not use it.

BTW, our tests shows that UBLK_IO_NEED_GET_DATA add one additional
round-trip in ublk_drv and one io_uring_enter() syscall.

UBLK_IO_NEED_GET_DATA does not lower the IOPS too much if:
(1) iodepth is bigger. This is because io_uring batches sqes(ioucmds) so the
    syscall overhead is not significant.
(2) the backend is slow. For example, with a network(RPC) backend, we really
    do not care this round-trip since the backend IO handling
    is far slower than ublk_drv's data path.

In conclusion, UBLK_IO_NEED_GET_DATA is designed for existing projects, not for
ublksrv(though it supports this feature) targets. UBLK_IO_NEED_GET_DATA is COMPLETELY
motivated by our real practice in developing userspace storage products.
