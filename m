The documentation claims that two sched groups must not overlap. This is
no longer true, as overlapping sched groups are used on NUMA systems.
This change has been introduced by commit e3589f6c81e47 and was
documented by an in-code comment in commit 35a566e6e8a18.

 Balancing within a sched domain occurs between groups. That is, each group
