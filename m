Sorry, but NACK, see below...

I think this is already happening in the text. What specifically do you
want described differently?

I don't like this because we had past trouble with notifications going
to the distros@ list and leaking Linux-only flaws to the BSDs. As there
isn't a separate linux-distros wiki, the clarification of WHICH list is
needed.

I don't think there's value in removing the Tue-Thu comment, nor
providing context for why distros need time. This has been a regular
thing we've had to explain to researchers that aren't familiar with
update procedures and publication timing.
