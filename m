In the patch that adds the REPLICATE_KTEXT config option, I've made it
exclusive with RANDOMIZE_BASE, but this change in layout isn't dependent
on REPLICATE_KTEXT.

I've tested it with RANDOMIZE_BASE=y, and nothing seems to get upset,
so I believe that this patch doesn't cause any negative issues.

Ah, thanks for pointing that out - I was hoping to avoid needing
to touch anything but L0 tables.

However, it brings up a question: are there any NUMA systems that would
have just two entries in the L0 table? I suspect NUMA systems have lots
of RAM, and so would want a page table layout that results in multiple
L0 entries.

Ok - so I need to get a bit more clever about calculating MODULES_END
and KIMAGE_VADDR

Ok, I'll take a look to see how my changes are impacted.

Okay, so that sounds like if this is fixed, then I won't need to patch
it! Yay!
