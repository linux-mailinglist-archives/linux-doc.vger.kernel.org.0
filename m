The compiler is forbidden from inventing pointer comparisons.

But yes, this is one reason why Documentation/RCU/rcu_dereference.rst
warns about pointer comparisons.

The old smp_read_barrier_depends() that these section cover really
does no longer exist.

This is covered in rcu_dereference.rst.  Or is something missing there?
Please note that the atomic_read() primitives operate on integers
rather than pointers, so are off the table.  Yes, in theory, some of
the value-returning atomic read-modify-write operations could head a
dependency chain, but these things are sufficiently heavyweight that
most situations would be better served by an _acquire() suffix than by
a relaxed version of such an atomic operation.

There is a bunch of text in rcu_dereference.rst to this effect.  Or
is there some aspect that is missing from that document?

The longer-term direction, perhaps a few years from now, is for the
first section to simply reference rcu_dereference.rst and for the second
section to be removed completely.

The problem is that people insist on diving into the middle of documents,
so sometimes repetition is a necessary form of self defense.  ;-)

But I very much appreciate your review and feedback, and I also apologize
for my slowness.
