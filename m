The motivation for me for this change is to avoid future bugs such as with
the following patch where "== 2" did not take the force write of
DYNTICK_IRQ_NONIDLE into account:
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/paulmck/linux-rcu.git/commit/?h=dev&id=13c4b07593977d9288e5d0c21c89d9ba27e2ea1f

I still don't see it as pointless churn, it is also a maintenance cost in its
current form and the simplification is worth it IMHO both from a readability,
and maintenance stand point.

I still don't see what's technically wrong with the patch. I could perhaps
add the above "== 2" point in the patch?

We could also discuss f2f at LPC to see if we can agree about it?

thanks,

 - Joel
