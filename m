Hello Dear,

I am Mrs. Ingram Olivia, I have decided to donate what I have to
Motherless babies/ Less privileged/ Widows' because I am dying and
diagnosed for cancer for about 10 years ago. I have been touched by
God Almighty to donate from what I have inherited from my late husband
to you for good work of God Almighty. I have asked Almighty God to
forgive me and believe he has, because he is a Merciful God, I'm
presently suffering from Leukemia.

My health condition has gotten worse and just two weeks ago my doctor
informed me that my condition has reach a critical stage, that I have
just 5 months left. This confirmation from my doctor was and still is
devastating news; it is hard to know that you have just a little time
left to live here.

After the doctor=E2=80=99s medical pronunciation that I have just few month=
s
to live, I decided to divide my wealth to contribute to your country.
I want to assist you with the funds to do great charity works in your
country, this is my last wish. I selected you after searching few
websites; I prayed and was led to you. I am willing to donate the sum
of ($8.1million ) to the less privileged through you.

Please I want to transfer this money to you, If you can handle this
fund and very sure to do charity works on my behalf then I will
include your name in my WILL  and from there I will travel to meet a
specialist as I want to be buried alongside my late husband when I
passed on.

Note that this fund is in the financial institution and upon my
instruction; I will file in an application for the transfer of the
money into your account for the said purpose.

Lastly, I honestly pray that this money when transferred will be used
for the said purpose even though I might be late then. I have come to
find out that wealth is vanity and I made a promise to God that my
wealth will be used to support the poor and the assist the sick. Do
let me know

if you will be able to handle this fund and use it for the said
purpose so that I will inform my bank on my decision, If you are
interested in carrying out this task, get back to me for more details
on this noble project of mine.

God bless you
Mrs.Ingram Olivia
