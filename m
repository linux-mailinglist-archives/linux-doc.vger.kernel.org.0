What is the disadvantage of reading the real hw wire state ? 

The list of advantages / disadvantages I can come up with GPIO
controllers which always allow access to the input buffers is:

Disadvantanges of having get() always return the input-buffer

1. It is slower then returning the last output value cached on
   the kernel side. But this too wil complicate the driver
   code, since this requires populating the cache at boot
   (or relying on regmap caching)

Advantages of having get() always return the input-buffer:

1. It leads to a very simple / KISS get() implementation
2. One has to wonder why a GPIO API consumer puts a pin
   in push/pull output mode and then calls get() anyways ?
   This is an unlikely scenario (making disadvantage 1.
   not a problem) and in the unlikely case that an API
   consumer does this they likely want the real hw wire state.

I guess the reason why you want to return a cached output value
is because not all GPIO controllers allow access to the input
buffer when in output mode ? At least that is the only good reason
I can come up with ?

Specifically there are GPIO controllers which have a single data
register for the GPIOs rather then separate data in + data out
registers.  Even then chances are that a read from the data
register *always* goes to the input-buffer rather then reading
the last written value when in output mode. This is likely since
simply always latching the data from the input-buffer on a read
from a shared in/out data register is easier to implement in hw.

So thinking more about this, I believe that the answer what
to return on a get() from a GPIO configured as push/pull output
is implementation dependent. For GPIO chips with a shared in/out
data register it is the value of that register, which may be
a cached output value or the input-buffer value and for GPIO
chips with a separate register to read the input-buffer it
should simply always be the input buffer.

Regards,

Hans
