It's certainly possible to handle the chardev unplug issue without
revocable as several subsystems already do. All you need is a refcount,
a lock and a flag.

It may be possible to provide a generic solutions at the chardev level
or some kind of helper implementation (similar to revocable) for
subsystems to use directly.

But revocable appears to be too fine grained for this as when the
device goes away all operations must cease. There's no need to track
mmio regions individually as was suggested. This may be the mental model
for someone working with rust, but it isn't necessarily a good fit for
the rest of the kernel.

It's a design pattern that's perhaps needed for rust, but not
necessarily elsewhere. But either way there is no need to rush this. If
it turns out to be usable, it can be merged along with a future user.

Dropping the revocable_provider and revocable abstraction split should
even make it more palatable.

And with a new interface and a non-trivial user we can see what the
end-result looks like and decide where to go from there.

Please reconsider. Perhaps I didn't stress the point enough that the
current API needs to be reworked completely since there's no longer any
need for the two revocable abstractions.
