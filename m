Absolutely agree; however, that is a bigger effort than what I am 
attempting to do here. So, let's remove composite version strings and 
integer strings from this series altogether, and simply make it more 
granular. The versioning will be solved later once we are ready to 
address the pre-kexec compatibility checking.
