I disagree this was the outcome of our previous discussion.

In nouveau I still need them to track the separate sparse page tables 
and, as you confirmed previously, Nvidia cards are not the only cards 
supporting this feature.

The second reason is that with regions we can avoid merging between 
buffers, which saves some effort. However, I agree that this argument by 
itself probably doesn't hold too much, since you've pointed out in a 
previous mail that:

<cite>
1) If we merge and decide to only do that inside certain boundaries then 
those boundaries needs to be provided and checked against. This burns 
quite some CPU cycles

2) If we just merge what we can we might have extra page table updates 
which cost time and could result in undesired side effects.

3) If we don't merge at all we have additional housekeeping for the 
mappings and maybe hw restrictions.
</cite>

However, if a driver uses regions to track its separate sparse page 
tables anyway it gets 1) for free, which is a nice synergy.

I totally agree that regions aren't for everyone though. Hence, I made 
them an optional feature and by default regions are disabled. In order 
to use them drm_gpuva_manager_init() must be called with the 
DRM_GPUVA_MANAGER_REGIONS feature flag.

I really would not want to open code regions or have two GPUVA manager 
instances in nouveau to track sparse page tables. That would be really 
messy, hence I hope we can agree on this to be an optional feature.
