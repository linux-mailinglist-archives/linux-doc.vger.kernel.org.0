I was kinda hoping I could get a chance to talk to you about this.

I managed to mark the trace buffer for inspection. By using the cmd line
argument to have it preallocated, it was very easy to just mark it for
inspection and dump it on a crash, as a dedicated meminspect region.

The problem is that all the meta-data is not allocated inside the
preallocated buffer. The meta-data is kmalloced all around the code. I
mean the structs that hold the information on what's in the buffer. You
know what I mean.
And all these kmalloced things, turn out to be in order of hundreds just
on a kernel boot, which I tested. This is not feasible for the
meminspect table, as it would get overcrowded very easily.
I thought of perhaps trying to kmalloc all of them in a dedicated cache,
but I haven't progressed on that. Another idea would be to try to
recreate the meta, but I have not found a way to do it yet.>

I used 'crash' tool with trace plugin and I am able to see all the trace
contents, but, with the limitation above. (To achieve this, I dumped a
huge area to include it, so , not feasible for my goal )

We could have some drivers pass the inspection table and then store it
in ramoops e.g., tapping into pstore. This idea has been going around,
but I have not had the chance to write a pstore thing yet.

So , I was stuck, and I was hoping to talk to you, either by email or
maybe at Plumbers in Tokyo where I have a talk about meminspect.

Thanks for looking into it,
Eugen
