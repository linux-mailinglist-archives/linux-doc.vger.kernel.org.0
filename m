 Testing of hotplug states
 =========================

 One way to verify whether a custom state is working as expected or not is to
 shutdown a CPU and then put it online again. It is also possible to put the CPU
 to certain state (for instance *CPUHP_AP_ONLINE*) and then go back to
 *CPUHP_ONLINE*. This would simulate an error one state after *CPUHP_AP_ONLINE*
 which would lead to rollback to the online state.
