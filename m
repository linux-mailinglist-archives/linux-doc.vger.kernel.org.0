These days, 80% of the work done by the security team consists in
locating the affected subsystem in a report, running get_maintainers on
it, forwarding the report to these persons and responding to the reporter
with them in Cc. This is a huge and unneeded overhead that we must try to
lower for a better overall efficiency. This patch adds a complete section
explaining how to figure the list of recipients to send the report to.

+disclosed as quickly as possible.
+
+Identifying contacts
+--------------------
+
+The most effective way to report a security bug is to send it directly to the
+affected subsystem's maintainers and Cc: the Linux kernel security team.  Do
+not send it to a public list at this stage, unless you have good reasons to
+consider the issue as being public or trivial to discover (e.g. result of a
+widely available automated vulnerability scanning tool that can be repeated by
+anyone).
+
+If you're sending a report for issues affecting multiple parts in the kernel,
+even if they're fairly similar issues, please send individual messages (think
+that maintainers will not all work on the issues at the same time). The only
+exception is when an issue concerns closely related parts maintained by the
+exact same subset of maintainers, and these parts are expected to be fixed all
+at once by the same commit, then it may be acceptable to report them at once.
+
+One difficulty for most first-time reporters is to figure the right list of
+recipients to send a report to.  In the Linux kernel, all official maintainers
+are trusted, so the consequences of accidentally including the wrong maintainer
+are essentially a bit more noise for that person, i.e. nothing dramatic.  As
+such, a suitable method to figure the list of maintainers (which kernel
+security officers use) is to rely on the get_maintainers.pl script, tuned to
+only report maintainers.  This script, when passed a file name, will look for
+its path in the MAINTAINERS file to figure a hierarchical list of relevant
+maintainers.  Calling it a first time with the finest level of filtering will
+most of the time return a short list of this specific file's maintainers::
+
+  $ ./scripts/get_maintainer.pl --no-l --no-r --pattern-depth 1 \
+    drivers/example.c
+  Developer One <dev1@example.com> (maintainer:example driver)
+  Developer Two <dev2@example.org> (maintainer:example driver)
+
+These two maintainers should then receive the message.  If the command does not
+return anything, it means the affected file is part of a wider subsystem, so we
+should be less specific::
+
+  $ ./scripts/get_maintainer.pl --no-l --no-r drivers/example.c
+  Developer One <dev1@example.com> (maintainer:example subsystem)
+  Developer Two <dev2@example.org> (maintainer:example subsystem)
+  Developer Three <dev3@example.com> (maintainer:example subsystem [GENERAL])
+  Developer Four <dev4@example.org> (maintainer:example subsystem [GENERAL])
+
+Here, picking the first, most specific ones, is sufficient.  When the list is
+long, it is possible to produce a comma-delimited e-mail address list on a
+single line suitable for use in the To: field of a mailer like this::
+
+  $ ./scripts/get_maintainer.pl --no-tree --no-l --no-r --no-n --m \
+    --no-git-fallback --no-substatus --no-rolestats --no-multiline \
+    --pattern-depth 1 drivers/example.c
+  dev1@example.com, dev2@example.org
+
+or this for the wider list::
+
+  $ ./scripts/get_maintainer.pl --no-tree --no-l --no-r --no-n --m \
+    --no-git-fallback --no-substatus --no-rolestats --no-multiline \
+    drivers/example.c
+  dev1@example.com, dev2@example.org, dev3@example.com, dev4@example.org
+
+If at this point you're still facing difficulties spotting the right
+maintainers, **and only in this case**, it's possible to send your report to
+the Linux kernel security team only.  Your message will be triaged, and you
+will receive instructions about whom to contact, if needed.  Your message may
+equally be forwarded as-is to the relevant maintainers.
