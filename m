If it makes sense that other pins could possibly ever be connected to
interrupts then we can add those and also add interrupt-names (but
only if there is more than one possible interrupt).

It looks like there are a few standardized properties, like
sense-resistor-ohms if that fits the use case. Otherwise, an
vendor-specific ti,rref-ohms would work. FYI, you can find the
preferred units at [1].

A compatible for motors seems too much. I was just thinking along the
lines that 1) if we need to so some scaling or something that depends
on a motor constant, then it would make sense to put those constants
in the DT and 2) if there is a motor controller with more than one
output that could be connected to two or more different sizes of
motors with different constants, then we either need child nodes or an
array to be able to enter the different constants. Either one would
work. So maybe simpler to just use an array instead of child nodes now
that I'm thinking about it more.
