5.4.0 came out in 2019, and the numbers there are:
	402	debugfs_remove
	461	debugfs_remove_recursive
So not quite.


But we are both ignoring debugfs_lookup_and_remove(), which I do
recommend people using over _both_ of those as there's no need to keep
anything around in the driver at all.

So that proves that you are right, and I'm wrong, as there is no
debugfs_lookup_and_remove_recursive()

A sed script for Linus at -rc1 is usually a good way to do this, but I
can throw some interns at it as well.  Or I can script it on my side and
just do a big push in one of my trees.

Ok, fair enough, I'm now convinced, I'll go take your patch now, sorry
for the noise, but thanks for the discussion.
