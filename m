Two memory ordering required here, atomic_set_release only provides one =
of them (the one you mentioned)

The objects are allocated with SLAB_TYPESAFE_BY_RCU, and there is:
=09
		n->next =3D first;

in hlist_add_head_rcu, which modifies obj->obj_node.next.

So, we must make sure obj->key is updated before obj->obj_node.next, =
without smp_wmb(), we can read
the new 'obj->obj_node.next=E2=80=99 value and previous value of =
'obj->key=E2=80=99 at the same time, and in this case, we
can not detect the movement of the object.
