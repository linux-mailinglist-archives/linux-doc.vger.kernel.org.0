Hi Lukasz,

Thank you for taking a look over the patches.

Unfortunately, I don't believe it to be be an edge-case. Given that this
is an optional feature, I do believe that people might skip on
implementing it on some CPUs(LITTLEs) while keeping it for CPUs(bigs)
where power and thermal mitigation is more probable to happen in firmware.
This is the main reason to be conservative in the validation of CPUs and
cpufreq policies.

In regards to arch_set_freq_scale, I want to be able to tell, when that
function is called, if I should return a scale factor based on cpufreq
for the current policy. If activity monitors are useable for the CPUs in
the full policy, than I'm bailing out and leave the AMU FIE machinery
set the scale factor. Unfortunately this works at policy granularity.

This could  be done in a nicer way by setting the scale factor per cpu
and not for all CPUs in a policy in this arch_set_freq_scale function.
But this would require some rewriting for the full frequency invariance
support in drivers which we've talked about for a while but it was not
the purpose of this patch set. But it would eliminate the policy
verification I do with the second workqueue.

I did initially give such a state machine a try but it proved to be
quite messy. A big reason for this is that the activity monitors unit
has multiple counters that can be used for different purposes.

The amu_feat per_cpu variable only flags that you have the AMU present
for potential users (in this case FIE) to validate the counters they
need for their respective usecase. For this reason I don't want to
overload the meaning of amu_feat. For the same reason I'm not doing the
validation of the counters in a generic way, but I'm tying it to the
usecase for particular counters. For example, it would not matter if
the instructions retired counter is not enabled from firmware for the
usecase of FIE. For frequency invariance we only need the core and
constant cycle counters and I'm making it the job of the user (arm64
topology code) to do the checking.

Secondly, for amu_scale_freq I could have added such a state machine,
but I did not think it was useful. The only thing it would change is
that I would not have to use the cpu_amu_fie variable in the data
structure that gets passed to the work functions. The only way I would
eliminate the second workqueue was if I did not do a check of all CPUs
in a policy, as described above, and rewrite frequency invariance to
work at CPU granularity and not policy granularity. This would eliminate
the dependency on cpufreq policy all-together, so it would be worth
doing if only for this reason alone :).

But even in that case, it's probably not needed to have more than two
states for amu_freq_scale.

What do you think?

Thank you,
Ionela.
