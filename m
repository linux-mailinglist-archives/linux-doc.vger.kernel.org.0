So I finally got around to actually giving this a try ...

It adds 1,095 warnings to an allmodconfig build here.  If I merge that,
I suspect that next thing that happens will be One Of Those Emails from
Linus... and perhaps from others as well.

If we had a series that drove the number to zero prior to this change,
it would be a different story.  I'm kind of thrashing and don't think I
can do that in the near future, as nice as it would be.  I suspect
there's not a lot of other folks just waiting for a chance to do this
either.

As nice as it would be to have this, I don't think it would survive to a
mainline release if I tried to push it now.  But maybe others disagree?

Thanks,

jon
