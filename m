Any last comments before I resend this?

Ive been made aware of
https://lore.kernel.org/all/20240730125346.1580150-1-usamaarif642@gmail.com=
/T/#u
which introduces THP splitting. These are both trying to achieve the
same thing through different means. Our approach leverages khugepaged
to promote pages, while Usama's uses the reclaim path to demote
hugepages and shrink the underlying memory.

I will leave it up to reviewers to determine which is better; However,
we can't have both, as we'd be introducing trashing conditions.

Cheers,
