If you or Willy think that this patch will impede memdesc progress, I am
okay not pushing this patchset upstream.

I was really excited when I found this trick to get rid of fake heads.
But ultimately, it is a clean up. I failed to find a performance win I
hoped for.

Also, I try to understand what 32-byte layout means for fake heads.
_refcount in struct page is going to 0 and refcounting happens on folios.
So I wounder if we can all pages identical (no tail pages per se) and
avoid fake heads this way?
