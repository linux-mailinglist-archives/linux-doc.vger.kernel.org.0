I would imagine that a normal FS case is to allocate some new memory
and then join it to the address_space and set mapping, so that makes
sense.

For fsdax, logically the DAX pages on the medium with struct pages
could be in the address_space as soon as the inode is created. That
would improve fault performance at the cost of making address_space
creation a lot slower, so I can see why not to do that.

For devdax if you can set the address space as part of initializing
each struct page and setting the compounds it would probably be a net
win?

Anyhow, I think what you did here is OK? Maybe I don't understand the
question 'whenever pgmap/page refcount changes happen'
