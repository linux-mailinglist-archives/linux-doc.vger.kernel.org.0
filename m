Maybe the changelog was a bit misleading here.
I did of course prefer negative entries, since that could bring down the 
number of cached entries. In retrospect that was probably a mistake but I 
was somewhat afraid if I don't reduce those, too, someone would shurely
point out that it would be easier to cut those, since they are not really
used anyway, and would be cheap to free.

This was only to be more useful than just solving _my_ problem. Maybe not
a good approach, I don't know yet.

You remember our conversation correctly and have masterfully summerized it in 
the passage above. Yes, that is what I'm trying to solve.

The problem we are facing is, that the fuse server has to keep a lot of private
data and some data for locks (DLM) for the cached inodes and dentries.
(inodes are even more expensive due to byte range locking)

So my idea was to NOT keep unused (and negative) entries around.
Letting the admin set the limit where the kernel starts to clean, was just
for convenience. If it was up to me I would like to set this in the initial
negotiation in FUSE during mount.

The waste of memory for me is not in the kernel but in the fuse server. The
kernel is just the master of what we have to keep, and thus the kernel moved
to the center of attention.

In short:
all caching in the kernel hurts us since we have to keep our private data
for all positive dentries, and I want to get the most for the amount pain.

OTOH caching meta data is really useful but you have to have a good prediction
on what to keep. As we cannot predict that on either side of the kernel,
throwing away the unused parts when they get out of hand seemed like a good idea.

After the discussions here it seems like everybody has his own interpretation on
what useful data to cache is.
I'm really inclined to think about letting the lower layers decide what useful
cached data should be.

In this context probably a fuse server message as a notification for which data
it thinks can be thrown out, similar to the FORGET call but in the other direction
and if the kernel agrees it really sends a FORGET and we can clean up on the other
side.

Thanks a lot for looking at this,
I really appreciate it!
... and I hope I could clarify, what I was trying to do.
