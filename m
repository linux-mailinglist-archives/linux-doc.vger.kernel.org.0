Ah, I see the problem, sorry I was dense before.  The patch is fixing a
change that went into linux-next via somebody else's tree.  So yeah, I
can't really apply that, it should go to whoever merged the original
(which is 0fab3ac21880 "hung_task: allow printing warnings every check
interval" BTW).  A Fixes: tag and a copy to the original author would also
be good.

Sorry for the confusion,

jon
