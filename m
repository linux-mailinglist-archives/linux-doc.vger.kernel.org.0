Hi Roman, thanks for taking the time to review this!

A timeout can be a good extension, I will add it to the commit message
in the next version in possible extensions.

I will add a test in v2, thanks!

My idea is to have these extensions as optional positional arguments
(like Wei suggested), so that the interface does not get too
complicated for users who don't care about tuning these options. If
this is the case then I think there is nothing to worry about.
Otherwise, if you think some of these options make sense to be a
required argument instead, we can rethink the initial interface.

I think in the RFC discussion there was consensus to add both a
per-memcg knob, as well as per-node / per-system knobs (through sysfs
or syscalls) later. Wei also points out that it's not common for a
syscall to have a cgroup argument.
