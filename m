Yes. We can reduce the number of UTF-8, but some documents need more
chars than ASCII can provide.

Btw, probably (almost?) all files under Documentation/translation use
UTF-8 charsets, due to obvious reasons.

Agreed.

Actually, a better workaround could be introduced at conf.py. This=20
file is read/parsed by Sphinx on an early stage.

Something could be added there that would detect if the machine's
charset is not UTF-8 and either produce a warning before starts
building or would change the charset used by python to something
that won't crash with utf-8.

Thanks,
