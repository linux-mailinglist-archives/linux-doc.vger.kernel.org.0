And "make htmldocs" does produce real HTML!  At first glance anyway,
quite impressive.

However, "make pdfdocs" gives me this complaint:

	! Dimension too large.
	\color@b@x ... #3}\kern \fboxsep }\dimen@ \ht \z@ 
							  \advance \dimen@ \fboxsep ...
	l.5092 \end{sphinxVerbatim}

This appears to come from Documentation/output/latex/RCU.tex.
There is nevertheless an RCU.pdf in this directory.  It is not
bad, but has a figure full of XML on PDF page 21.  And a few later
on as well.

On the HTML side, the quick quizzes have immediately visible answers,
which defeats the purpose.  The original HTML used a white font,
so that you selected the answer with your mouse to make it visible.
Can something similar be done with Sphinx?  Another approach is to
gather the answers into a separate file and link to them.

I believe that Joel already noted that internal links are not working.
The external links that I tried work just fine, though.  As do the
links from the table of contents.

							Thanx, Paul
