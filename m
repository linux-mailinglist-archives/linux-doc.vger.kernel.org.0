Thanks for the suggestion and it does make sense to me. But I've tried it and met some problems.
I intended to create two attribute groups for each kind of filter and create attribute for each
available filter. like:

$ ls root_port_filters    # each filter exists as an sysfs attribute
0000:00:10.0 0000:00:11.0
$ cat root_port_filters/0000:00:10.0    # read the attribute get the filter value
0x80001

In pratice we may have no filter for certain types, for example no endpoint found on this PCIe
core then we'll have no filter attributes under requester_filters directory. Or if endpoint
devices are hot removed or manually removed through sysfs by the user, the filter attributes
will be created/destroyed dynamically (will support following this series, an implementation
will be like in [1]) which may make the directory empty. But sysfs won't allow to have an
empty attribute group, restricted in [2].
