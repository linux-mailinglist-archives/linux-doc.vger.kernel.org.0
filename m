Hi! Sorry for the delay in my review of this series -- it's been a busy
couple of weeks for me. :) I'm still travelling this week, but I want to
give this a good review. I really like the idea of having a block device
backend for pstore; I'm excited to get this feature landed.

I think there may be a lot of redundancy between ramoops and the block
code in this series, but I suspect the refactoring of that can happen at
a later time. I'd like to get this reviewed and tested and see if I can
land it in the v5.7 merge window.

I hope to have time to focus on this next week once I'm back in my
normal timezone. ;)

Thanks again!

-Kees
