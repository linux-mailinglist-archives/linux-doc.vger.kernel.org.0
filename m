The logic which parse files at get_abi.pl is this one:

    sub parse_abi {
        my $file =3D $File::Find::name;

        my $mode =3D (stat($file))[2];
        return if ($mode & S_IFDIR);
        return if ($file =3D~ m,/README,);

Currently, it ignores just README and directories.

It wouldn't be hard to add something like:

	return if ($file =3D~ m,/\.(rej|org|orig|bak)$,);

to ignore certain extensions. On such case, we would need to explicitly
add the extensions to be Ignored.

We could, instead, do a broader regex:

	return if ($file =3D~ m,/\.,);

to ignore everything that would have a dot at the file name, but that
could be problematic if we ever end adding files with extensions
there.

Regards,
Mauro
