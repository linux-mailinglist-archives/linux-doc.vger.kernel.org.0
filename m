I have added some of James' debug patches at:
https://gitlab.arm.com/linux-arm/linux-bh/-/tree/mpam_resctrl_glue_v5_debugfs?ref_type=heads

These are on top of a v5 of the series. They apply to older series
as well.

The debugfs should then contain details of all the MSC which
should help debugging.

It would be great if you were able to share that information, either on list or
privately if needed.

You can snapshot the mpam debugfs using:

find /sys/kernel/debug/mpam -type f -exec sh -c 'echo {}; cat {}' \; > mpam_debugfs.txt
