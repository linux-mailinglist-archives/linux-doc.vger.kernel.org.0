I think the explanatory comments are what makes this patch look huge.
The code changes are pretty small and simple:
- track bw of SCHED_RECLAIM_TASKS
- modify the reclamation equation.

Sorry about this, I will rephrase it.

This patch uses a different equation than [1] and updated the kernel
doc as well in patch 2 of this series. I understand "re-written" is
confusing and will rephrase it.

I have tested both. Actually I tested 3 scenarios:
- Started the threads at the same time
- Started the threads separately (5-10 seconds apart)
- Started the threads at the same time with some of them sleeping for
  a while before spinning. This was to see if transition from
  NonContending to Inactive was showing any issues with this patch.

I feel it could go with this patch as the code changes in this patch
are fairly small and the function is trivial. But I can split it if
you feel that this patch is really huge and needs splitting.
