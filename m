Just to be clear, when I'm talking about PEP8, I'm actually referring
to the language support for import a python code with "import" and "from". 

The rationale is that some day we may end needing using autodoc(*), or
some other Sphinx extension that would require it, like argparse ones:

	https://sphinxcontrib-autoprogram.readthedocs.io/en/stable/
	https://pypi.org/project/sphinxcontrib-autoprogram/

This would avoid the need of documenting some things twice: at the
code and at the documentation itself.

(*) Right now, we don't have any strong reasons to use autodoc on
    kernel-doc exec: the only possible reason on kernel-doc would be
    to avoid documenting return codes twice, but we could do it also
    via argparse, with something like:

	RETURN_CODE=deident("""
	    The return value is:

	    - 0: success or Python version is not compatible with
	      kernel-doc.  If -Werror is not used, it will also
	      return 0 if there are issues at kernel-doc markups;

	    - 1: an abnormal condition happened;

	    - 2: argparse issued an error;

	    - 3: if -Werror is used, and one or more unfiltered parse
		warnings happened.
	""")

	argparse.ArgumentParser(formatter_class=argparse.RawTextHelpFormatter,
                                description=DESC, epilog=RETURN_CODE)

    Eventually, it could be useful to use an argparse extension in
    the future, if we want to add the help output inside the
    auto-generated docs.

    Anyway, after having this series merged and mine fixing
    the issues with -Werror, I intend to send you a separate patch
    series with something like the above and moving MsgFormatter
    to a separate module.
	
Thanks,
Mauro
