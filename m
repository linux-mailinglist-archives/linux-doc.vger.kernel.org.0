Why not use normal tracepoints and the tracing infrastructure? You can
add your own instance as rasdaemon does, which isn't affected by other
tracing. There's code now to even create these instances and enable and
disable events from within the kernel.

As this is tracefs, you can mount it without even compiling in debugfs.
