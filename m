Yeah, of course, this is not questioning your abilities at all. Winning
the trust of the community step by step in a gradual manner is
definitely better. This is something I have once again realized while
going through the lore archives of how the Git localization was done. By
reading their historical exchanges (between Junio C Hamano and Jiang
Xin), we might be able to obtain some practical experience and
precautions regarding the process. But this is not something that needs
to be considered at present.

Ah got it, so this is why we need a local to guard a pass ;-)

I definitely agree. Batching them would be easier to review and
retrospect, and it's better to track on the list.

Then I'm exaggerating, oops.

Yes, and I suspect that some of the documents might not actually need to
be translated? I will conduct some more investigations.

Yes, and that's documented in here,

https://docs.kernel.org/translations/zh_CN/how-to.html

so later zh_TW could consider making one.

Agreed. The significance of the initial stage for newcomers is
self-evident. Of course, the English documents have undoubtedly been
constantly revised over time. So for these two Chinese documents, this
part is of crucial importance. After all, this is where almost everyone
begins to read, including me. So when I found that there was a Chinese
translation here, I was very happy ;-)

OK, the AI thing has still inevitably come up ;-)

I can spend an entire afternoon reading the discussion emails and
articles about AI/LLM in the community ;-)

  Sidenote:
  I noticed that there seems to be renewed discussion in the English
  document section about removing the "assisted-by" trailer. It would be
  a good idea to make a note of this and see if we need to update any
  relevant sections.

However, personally speaking, I still prefer to read the official
website's documents. It was written by the developers, and of course it
is more authoritative than the content produced by AI/LLM. And sometimes
the information provided by the AI/LLM is a bit behind the information
on the official website kernel.org.

Thanks, I'll learn about it too.
