OK, but that's not necessarily true. I have seen these complaints from the
kernel but in all the cases I remember it was due to negative dentries
accumultating in a particular directory. There are certain apps such as
ElasticSearch which really do like creating huge amounts of negative
dentries in one directory - they use hashes as filenames and use directory
lookup instead of a DB table lookup and lookup lots of non-existent keys...

OK, thanks.

Close but not quite. The cost is the overhead of dget_parent() in
fsnotify_parent() which is often a couple of cache cold loads and atomic
instructions to find out we don't need to send any event for the current
write(2) or read(2) call. It gets worse if there are many IOs happening to
dentries in the same directory from multiple CPUs because instead of
cache-cold loads you get a cacheline contention on the parent.

Parent dentry is of course in memory but often cache cold - you don't need
the parent to do e.g. write(2) to an already open file. You seem to be
somewhat confused about the child dentry list traversal (or maybe I'm
misunderstanding) - that happens only when placing the notification mark
but definitely not for each IO operation.
