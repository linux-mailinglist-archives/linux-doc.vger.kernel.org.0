I fixed it with the patch shown below.  Some words about: The use
of the :doc: rule should be replaced by a :ref:.  The path names
of include directives should always relative to the .rst file.

To go further ... with patch below:

    $ make SPHINXDIRS="driver-api" htmldocs

shows some " WARNING: undefined label: ..." messages.  To close
such links (addressing objects outside of the SPHINXDIR) we need
to activate intersphinx [1].

If we activate intersphinx we have to wait one release cycle to
get a objects.inv file at:

    https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/

When the objects.inv file is available, the warnings are
disappear.  

If the process of intersphinx is unclear, please ask.
