The audience for this particular doc is platform folks who want to know
what limitations there are on cxl-device hotplug in linux.

This originated from a discussion at LPC where some device folks
understood the hotplug process, but did not understand the linux
limitations (in particular around the CFMWS and node creation).

Tl;dr: Linux consumes ACPI tables to generate NUMA nodes and constructs
memory regions.  This is linux "having an opinion" on "how ACPI tables
should reasonably be constructed" - and this tries to document that.

This is all obviously mutable, but it at least helps drive understanding
between device, bios, platform, and linux if we at least have this
document that says "this is what Linux wants/expects".

I'm not sure what if anything I would reference in the spec, since this
largely describes what linux wants, not what the spec says is possible.

Happy to improve.

This is more precise and concise.  I can change that.

This does say: "if the region size is greater than the CFMWS size"

But maybe it's more accurate to say "if the unused CFMWS HPA space is
smaller than a user-defined memory region capacity".

This is really all saying the same thing though - if your device
capacity is smaller than your CFMWS, you can't map the entire device.

Linux specific piece here is the fact that once Linux proceeds past
__init, you cannot achieve hotplug for CXL memory not described (or
insufficiently described) in the ACPI tables.

In this case - memory is special.  We're (linux) basically telling
platform vendors "You can't add memory you haven't described in some way
since the beginning of time".

It's unclear that the same would be true on all operating systems, but
it is true on linux.

---

general note - i'm happy to drop this if folks think it's not the right
place to put it, but based on LPC discussions and feedback from Jonathan
and Dan, it seemed useful.

Maybe I should just be writing a book instead, lol. (Please no)
