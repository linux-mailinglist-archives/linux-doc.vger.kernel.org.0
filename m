Perhaps specify "linux-distros@" without a domain, so it's more clear?
Or re-split the Wiki into two pages to avoid confusion?

Yeah, that seems useful to include in both places.

Right; that'd be good to add as well. I see a lot of panic on twitter,
for example, about bugs that only ever existed in -rc releases.

I don't know the origin of the leaks, but it only happened when distros@
was used instead of linux-distros@. I think this happened with DirtyCOW,
