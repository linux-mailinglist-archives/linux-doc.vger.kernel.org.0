Not all, but those that are part of the kAPI requires good documentation.

Driver-specific functions could remain out of doc build - or be part
of the documentation. It should be a decision of the driver authors,
that may or may not be expecting contributions from the community.

Agreed. What I said is that this is a good start point, as it sounds
to me that we do have kAPI documentation inside headers but not
exported to the documentation.

Agreed. Things look better those days, but just because right now
there are several warnings disabled by default.

On media, our CI builds with W=1, and aim to have no warnings.

Good idea. If you have some time, feel free to propose some patches.

Checking the entire set of files inside the Kernel with kernel-doc
is fast. Using the new make mandocs, for instance, with reads the
entire tree takes about 45 seconds on my machine:

	$ time make mandocs
	...
	real    0m44,211s
	user    0m35,787s
	sys     0m3,274s

(and reports thousands of warnings)

Thanks,
Mauro
