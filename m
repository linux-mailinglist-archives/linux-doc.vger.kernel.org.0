Doing a bump at Documentation/sphinx/requirements.txt doesn't mean that people 
using have older versions would need to upgrade, as we don't need to bump the
minimal requirement at Documentation/conf.py, nor the versions suggested by 
scripts/sphinx-pre-install.

So, I don't see a problem on setting it to use sphinx==4.3.2 (or some other 
version).

Yet, I would keep using a known-to-be-good version, instead of letting
pip to just get the latest one.

We need to verify both PDF and html generation, though, as I remember
that some 4.x versions had/(have?) issues with the C domain and duplicate
symbols detection.

Also, it could be worth to check the build time with 2.4.4 and with
whatever newer version we stick.

Agreed.

Thanks,
