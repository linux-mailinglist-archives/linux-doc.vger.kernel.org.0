My suggestion was mainly for sanity checking. So if LUO or another user
inadvertently changes entry size, it gets caught. But thinking about it
more, there are a million other ways to break compatibility while
keeping the entry size same so perhaps it doesn't matter as much...

Yeah, I got that when reading the later patches that use these.

Perhaps kho_block_prealloc() and kho_block_unalloc() is more clear,
although it does not sound as nice. If not, then I suppose at least add
a comment explaining the intended usage.

You can do this:

#define KHO_BLOCK_SET_INIT(_name, _entry_size) {                        \
	.blocks = LIST_HEAD_INIT((_name).blocks),                       \
	.entry_size = _entry_size,                                      \
	.count_per_block = (KHO_BLOCK_SIZE - sizeof(struct kho_block_header_ser)) / (_entry_size), \
}

Compiles for me.

IMO it would be cleaner for kho_block_destroy() to destroy the currently
initialized block set, and then the error handling path in restore path
can clean up the rest.

I think we can make kho_block_it_next() always write it. I think it
makes sense from an API point of view, since I see this API as "adding
an entry to the block set", so updating its internal counters makes
sense.

Requiring the finalize will be error prone, since it is easy to forget.
Then you silently lose some entries on the next boot.
