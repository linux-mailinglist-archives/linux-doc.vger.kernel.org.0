True, but with memory.high there's the risk to trash some applications
badly if I'm not reacting fast at increasing memory.high.

However, something that I could definitely want to try is to move all
the memory hogs to a cgroup, set memory.high to a very small value and
then immediately set it back to 'max'. The effect should be pretty much
the same as calling shrink_all_memory(), that is what I'm doing with my
memory.swap.reclaim.

Yes, Michal pointed out to me his work, it's basically the same approach
that I'm using.

I started this work with a patch that was hibernation specific
(https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20200601160636.148346-1-andrea.righi@canonical.com/);
this v2 was the natural evolution of my previous work and I didn't
notice that something similar has been posted in the meantime.

Anyway, I already contacted Shakeel, so we won't duplicate the efforts
in the future. :)

Thanks for your feedback!
