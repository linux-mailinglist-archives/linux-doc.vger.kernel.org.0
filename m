Because of optimistic spinning, a mutex_lock()/mutex_unlock() can 
succeed even if there are still waiters waiting for the lock.

What I mean is that the mutex is in an unlocked state ready to be 
acquired by another locker. mutex_is_locked() considers the state of the 
mutex as locked if any of the owner flags is set.

Beside the mutex_lock()/mutex_unlock() sequence, I will suggest adding a 
mutex_is_locked() check just to be sure.
