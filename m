Palmer suggested at some point, not sure if it was in one of the
weekly linux-riscv syncs, or a conversation at FOSDEM, that we
should document the role of the automation running on our patchwork
instance plays in patch acceptance.

Add a short note to the patch-acceptance document to that end.

The bit about fixes being applied to riscv/fixes is not actually
correct, it's actually linux-next/pending-fixes. We've not had issues
with the fixes branch being broken in a while, but I switched it over
to pending-fixes due to the KVM breakage. I'll swap back to match the
documentation I'm adding.

I was also not sure if this was the correct doc for this, or whether a
process/maintainer-riscv.rst file was better suited. There's clearly no
rush on this though so ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

+Patchwork
+---------
+
+RISC-V has a patchwork instance, where the status of patches can be checked:
+
+  https://patchwork.kernel.org/project/linux-riscv/list/
+
+If your patch does not appear in the default view, the RISC-V maintainers have
+likely either requested changes, or expect it to be applied to another tree.
+
+Automation runs against this patchwork instance, building/testing patches as
+they arrive. The automation applies patches against the current HEAD of the
+RISC-V `for-next` and `fixes` branches, depending on whether the patch has been
+detected as a fix. The exact commit to which a series has been applied will be
+noted on patchwork.
+Patches for which any of the checks fail are unlikely to be applied and in most
+cases will need to be resubmitted.
