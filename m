You're right that these conditions are narrow. However, when these bugs
hit, they're severe and extremely difficult to debug. This year alone,
this specific buffer_head bug was hit at least twice: 1bb7ff4204b6 and my
case. Over 24 years, others likely encountered it but lacked tools to
pinpoint the root cause.

I used software KASAN for the exfat case, but the bug didn't reproduce,
likely due to timing changes from the overhead. More fundamentally, the
corruption was in-bounds within active stack frames, which KASAN cannot
detect by design.

Beyond buffer_head, I encountered another stack corruption bug in network
drivers this year. Without KStackWatch, I had to manually instrument the
code to locate where corruption occurred.

These issues may be more common than they appear. Given Linux's massive
user base combined with the kernel's huge codebase and the large volume of
driver code, both in-tree and out-of-tree, even narrow conditions will be
hit.

Since posting earlier versions, several developers have contacted me about
using KStackWatch for their own issues. KStackWatch fills a gap: it can
pinpoint in-bounds stack corruption with much lower overhead than KASAN.
