We avoid excessive markup to keep the files as readable as possible in
plain text. Adding or using infrastructure does not conflict with this.

Perhaps making it possible to have the whole English documentation
structure, with certain pages translated to other
languages. Additionally you could have language specific tables of
contents for each language, perhaps automatically generated.

I.e. make the translations more accessible.

They turned into global duplicate labels due to an error in the
hyperlink markup. There is no problem with proper markup.

And tying this back to the beginning, IMHO the named hyperlinks are
*less* of an eyesore than inline markup. Contrast:

	See Foo_.

.. _Foo: http://example.org/what-if-you-have-a-really-long-url

With:

	See `Foo <http://example.org/what-if-you-have-a-really-long-url>`_.

Of course, in this case we also need the backticks in the named targets
because they contain brackets and hyphens; that could be changed
too. Also, you don't have to collect the named targets at the bottom of
the file, you can place them between paragraphs, and it'll be neat in
plain text too.


BR,
Jani.
