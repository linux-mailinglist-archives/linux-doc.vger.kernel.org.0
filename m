No.  There is no use case.  The entire point of CoCo is that the VMM is untrusted.
Having the guest rely on the VMM to zero memory makes no sense whatsoever.  There
may be a contract between the trusted whatever and the guest, but that's between
those two entities, the VMM is not involved, period.

PRESERVE is different because the intent is to allow the guest to operate on
*untrusted* data.  Operating on untrusted zeros is nonsensical.

ZERO for private=>shared is different between the VMM trusts the host kernel.

Yes.

No.  No, no, no, no.  I have said this over, and over, and over.  The contract
is between userspace and KVM, not between userspace and the underlying CoCo
implementation.  Anything that requires making assumptions based on the VM type
is a non-starter for me.

Huh?  Oh, you don't mean "enum", you mean "values vs. flags".  Because in C you
can obviously have an enum of flags.

I don't have a strong preference, though I think I'd vote for flags.

Practically speaking, I doubt we'll ever have more than DEFAULT, ZERO, and PRESERVE,
i.e. more than '0', '1, and '2'.  Perhaps I lack imagination, but I can't think
of any operation that we would want to become ABI.  ZERO is special purely because
various CoCo implementations already zero memory on conversion.  Everything else
fits into PRESERVE, because if the kernel perform the operation, then userspace
can do the same, and likely more performantly and obviously without needing a
contract with KVM.

The only other option I can think of is if a CoCo implementation wanted to use an
specific value other than '0' to fill a page on conversion.  Given that starting
from '0' is by far the most common state in computing, I just don't see that
happening.  E.g. that's be like adding k1salloc() in addition to kmalloc() and
kzalloc().

So, we're likely only going to have DEFAULT, ZERO, and PRESERVE, at which point
whether we use flags or values is a wash in terms of how many bits we need: 2.

If we use flags, then we can have a single CAP to enumerate all FLAGS that are
supported KVM_SET_MEMORY_ATTRIBUTES2.  If we use values, we'd need a separate CAP
for flags and a separate cap for conversion operations.

Using values would allow providing a dedicated field in kvm_memory_attributes2,
which _might_ make some code more readable.  But for me, that doesn't outweigh the
disadvantage of needing another CAP.
