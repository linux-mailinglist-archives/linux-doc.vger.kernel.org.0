In commit 82e896d992fa ("docs: net: page_pool: use kdoc to avoid
duplicating the information") I shied away from using the DOC:
comments when moving to kdoc for documenting page_pool API,
because I wasn't sure how familiar people are with it.

Turns out there is already a DOC: comment for the intro, which
is the same in both places, modulo what looks like minor rewording.
Use the version from Documentation/ but keep the contents with
the code.

 Page Pool API
 =============
 
-The page_pool allocator is optimized for the XDP mode that uses one frame
-per-page, but it can fallback on the regular page allocator APIs.
-
-Basic use involves replacing alloc_pages() calls with the
-page_pool_alloc_pages() call.  Drivers should use page_pool_dev_alloc_pages()
-replacing dev_alloc_pages().
-
-API keeps track of in-flight pages, in order to let API user know
-when it is safe to free a page_pool object.  Thus, API users
-must call page_pool_put_page() to free the page, or attach
-the page to a page_pool-aware objects like skbs marked with
-skb_mark_for_recycle().
-
-API user must call page_pool_put_page() once on a page, as it
-will either recycle the page, or in case of refcnt > 1, it will
-release the DMA mapping and in-flight state accounting.
