Right, so a fairness concern?

I wonder if we should just reclaim a batch from each memcg, then check
if we reached the goal, otherwise start over. If the batch size is small
enough that should work?

Right, I understand that in theory we need a cursor. I am just wondering
if the complexity is justified in practice. Reclaim is a much larger
beast than zswap writeback. I wonder if we can just get away with
scanning a batch from each child memcg -- for per-memcg reclaim, not
global.

We can always improve it later with a cursor if there's an actual need.

What if we do something like this (for the global cursor):

	do {
		memcg = xchg(zswap_next_shrink, NULL);
		memcg = mem_cgroup_iter(NULL, memcg, NULL);
		/* If the cursor was advanced from under us, try again */
		if (!try_cmpxchg(zswap_next_shrink, NULL, memcg))
			continue;
	} while (..);
			

There is a window where a racing shrinker will see the cursor as NULL
and start over, but that should be fine. We can generalize this for the
per-memcg cursor.

That being said..

..this made me realize it's probably fine to just use a global lock for
now?

IIUC the only additional contention to the existing lock will be from
userspace proactive writeback, and that shouldn't be a big deal
especially with the critical section being short?

I think we should experiment with the global lock first. See if you
observe any regressions with workloads that put a lot of pressure on the
lock (a lot of threads in reclaim doing writeback + a few userspace
threads doing proactive writeback). See if the userspace threads
actually cause a meaningful regression.
