Will the reported pin state remain "connected" even if I disconnect
the input signal?
Is there any information in DPLL or pin replies that can tell the user
"this DPLL is unmanaged type, it behaves differently"?

Yep, gladly!
Telco customers rely on the Phase being locked on the reference with a
certain precision. In E810 and zl3073x the equation is simple:
1. "eec locked" means synTonization achieved - frequency locked
2. "pps locked" means synChronization achieved - phase locked
The T-BC application checks the reported device type. If the device
type is "pps", the report is processed by the synchronization state
decision logic. Otherwise, the report doesn't have any meaning within
"T-BC without SyncE" context and is discarded.

Since this patch is going to create eec reports only, they are all
going to be discarded, and this is a compatibility issue I'm trying to
address.

Could you please answer my question above:
What is the physical meaning of this indication
(lock-status':'locked') in this report?

Thanks!
