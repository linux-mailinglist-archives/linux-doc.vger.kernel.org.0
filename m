I don't really get why we would need to do that? If you put the PFN
info in the virtual / upper layer, then the count info, locking, and
all swap IO synchronization (via folio lock), dup (current protected
by ci lock / folio lock), and allocation (folio_alloc_swap), are all
handled in this layer.

The physical / lower layer will just hold a reverse entry on
folio_realloc_swap, or no entry at all (no physical layer used, zswap,
or after swap allocation but before IO) right?

Looking up the actual folio from the physical layer will be a bit
slower since it needs to resolve the reverse entry, but the only place
we need to do that is things like migrate, compaction (none of them
exist yet) which seems totally fine?

Thanks. Not too complicated, actually our internal kernel
implementation still using si->percpu cluster, and use a counter for
the rotation and each order have a counter :P, it's a bit ugly but
works fine. It still serves pretty well just like the global percpu
cluster, YoungJun's previous per ci percpu cluster also still provides
the fast path, many ways to do that.

I mean if the per-cpu cache is moved to si level, then whoever enters
the allocation path of a si will almost always get a stable percpu
cache to use, even if the last used si changes.

We might better have a more explicit per si fast path for that. The
plist rotation should better be done in a different (will be even
better if lockless) way.

If mixed backend means phys vs zero vs zswap, then we already have
part of that covered with the current swap cache except for the phys
part (zswap part seems very doable with fujunjie's work).
swap_cache_alloc_folio will ensure there is no mixed zerobit, it can
be easily extended to ensure there is no mixed zswap as well
(according to what I've learned from fujunjie's code). Similar logic
for phys detection I think.

Maybe you don't need to record memcg here since folio->memcg already
have that info?

I previously had a patch:
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-mm/20260220-swap-table-p4-v1-7-104795d19815@t=
encent.com/

The defers the recording of memcg, the behavior is almost identical to
before, but charging & recording should be cleaner and you don't need
to record memcg at allocation time hence maybe reduce the possibility
of pinning a memcg. I didn't include that in P4 just to reduce LOC,
maybe can be resent or included.

Good to know, it's not too messy to make everything dynamic, but if
our ultimate goal is to account for them separately, maybe we can save
some effort here.

No problem, good to see progress here :)
