On this specific example, it should have detected a non-anonymous=20
union inside it and replace u8_data with "value.u8_data". I added some
debug prints to it (see enclosed). Running it with a file with just the
problematic struct shows:

$ ./scripts/kernel-doc --yaml a.yaml --kdoc a.h
Info: members: const char *name; size_t length; bool is_inline; enum dev_pr=
op_type type; union { const void *pointer; union { u8 u8_data[sizeof(u64) /=
 sizeof(u8)]; u16 u16_data[sizeof(u64) / sizeof(u16)]; u32 u32_data[sizeof(=
u64) / sizeof(u32)]; u64 u64_data[sizeof(u64) / sizeof(u64)]; const char *s=
tr[sizeof(u64) / sizeof(char *)]; } value; };
s_id value
s_id=20
Info: members: const char *name; size_t length; bool is_inline; enum dev_pr=
op_type type; union ; const void pointer; union value; u8 u8_data[sizeof(va=
lue.u64) / sizeof(u8)]; u16 u16_data[sizeof(value.u64) / sizeof(u16)]; u32 =
u32_data[sizeof(value.u64) / sizeof(u32)]; u64 u64_data[sizeof(value.u64) /=
 sizeof(u64)]; const char *str[sizeof(value.u64) / sizeof(char *)]; ; ;=20

It seems that the problem is related with handling the anonymous union.
See, the logic inside kernel-doc to parse nested struct/union is probably
the most complex one inside kernel-doc.=20

This is a bug, due to the lack of proper support for nested structs/unions.
If you add an extra print to members at the end of the rewrite function,
it handles the struct as if it were defined as:

	struct {
		const char *name;
		size_t length;
		bool is_inline;
		enum dev_prop_type type;
		union;
		const void pointer;
		union value;
		u8 u8_data[sizeof(value.u64) / sizeof(u8)];
		u16 u16_data[sizeof(value.u64) / sizeof(u16)];
		u32 u32_data[sizeof(value.u64) / sizeof(u32)];
		u64 u64_data[sizeof(value.u64) / sizeof(u64)];
		const char *str[sizeof(value.u64) / sizeof(char *)];
	}

e.g.:
	- the struct got flatten;
	- unions become named or unamed members, with no content;
	- the inner unions themselves (or struct) won't have any
	  members.

If we fix the bug, what we would see there would be:

	struct {
		const char *name;
		size_t length;
		bool is_inline;
		enum dev_prop_type type;
		union;
		const void pointer;
		union value;
		u8 value.u8_data[sizeof(value.u64) / sizeof(u8)];
		u16 value.u16_data[sizeof(value.u64) / sizeof(u16)];
		u32 value.u32_data[sizeof(value.u64) / sizeof(u32)];
		u64 value.u64_data[sizeof(value.u64) / sizeof(u64)];
		const char *str[sizeof(value.u64) / sizeof(char *)];
	}

Such conversion is ugly, but the logic was written with the concept
of:

	"If all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail"

So, basically, in the past there was a parser for normal structs that
works fine with non-nested struct and was already complex enough.
Avoid breaking the logic, the flatten logic was added on the top of it.

The rationale behind using a qualifier like "x.y" is that sometimes you
may have things like this:

	struct foo {
		struct {
			int size; /** Size of received data */
		} rx;
		struct {
			int size; /** Maximum TX size */
		} tx;
	};

Where "size" could either be rx.size or tx.size and they require
different descriptions. I'm pretty sure I picked some real
cases like that in the past.

When I migrated the code, I carefully tried to keep the same logic
on most of the code, being bug-compatible with the old version,
reducing the risk of regressions. So, this logic is the same as
we had on Perl.

-

The function which handles this is at:

    def rewrite_struct_members(self, members)
...
		    for s_id in rest.split(','):
...
			r =3D KernRe(r'^([^\(]+\(\*?\s*)([\w.]*)(\s*\).*)')
                        if r.match(arg):
                            dtype, name, extra =3D r.group(1), r.group(2), =
r.group(3)
                            # Pointer-to-function
                            if not s_id:
                                # Anonymous struct/union
                                newmember +=3D f"{dtype}{name}{extra}; "
                            else:
                                newmember +=3D f"{dtype}{s_id}.{name}{extra=
}; "
                        #


A "quick" fix would be to use a stack to push s_id, like:

	id_stack =3D []

and something to control when it is inside or outside the
loop, like

	level =3D 0
	old_level =3D 0

	<some loop that would increment/decrement level>

	if level > old_level:
		id_stack.append(s_id)		# Python "push"

	if level < old_level:
		id_stack.pop()

and, at the part that fills the name, use:

	ids =3D ".".join(id_stack)
        if not ids:
            newmember +=3D f"{r.group(1)} {name}; "
	else:
            newmember +=3D f"{r.group(1)} {s_id}.{name}; "

However, while looking into it, I guess it is time for us to part
away from the current approach, replacing it by a logic that works
better with nested structs, in a similar way to NestedMatch=20
implementation.

The problem with the current implementation is that it uses
lots of complex regex transformations to identify nested
patterns, on a way that it is not error-prone.

My proposal is to switch to a different logic that will
create (on this example) a list like this:

	member_names =3D [
		["name"],
		["length"],
		["is_inline"],
		["type"],
		["pointer"],
		["value", "u8_data"]
		["value", "u16_data"]
		["value", "u32_data"]
		["value", "u64_data"]
		["value", "str"]
	]

With that, cases like twe have duplicated names like here:

	struct {
		char *name;
		struct {
			u8 u8_data;
		} val_1;
		struct {
			u8 u8_data;
		} val_2;
	}

The member list will be:

	member_names =3D [
		["name"],
		["val_1", "u8_data"]
		["val_2", "u8_data"]
	]

By doing that, kernel-doc can accept both a "lazy" behavior
for the cases where "u8_data" is unique, while still accepting
the full name: "value.u8_data".

I have already a code to produce it, but I still need to bind it
to the dump struct logic. Once I have it there, I'll submit a patch
series.

See above. Probably the code that flatten the union didn't work
fine (maybe due to "[").

Yes, but once we implement a list like the one I proposed,
kernel-doc could support both ways.

I don't think so: one of the first things the logic does is to get
rid of typedef.

I'm pretty sure that trying to keep the current approach of
beating at the struct until it becomes flatten will always be
buggy. We need a logic that will just parse it, identifying
each level and produce a member representation without needing
to transform them into something else.

As a reference, I'm enclosing the patch I wrote to support
the new approach, together with an unit test for it. With the
structs inside it, the code is properly identifying the inner
structs/unions, when there  "private:" comments(*).

(*) There is currently a bug handling private - I have already a
    patch series addressing it.

Thanks,
Mauro

[PATCH] docs: kdoc: create a new logic to better handle struct/union members

The logic inside rewrite_struct_members() is messy and error
prune. As pointed by Randy Dunlap, parsing an struct like this,
for instance:

    struct property_entry {
        const char *name;
        size_t length;
        bool is_inline;
        enum dev_prop_type type;
        union {
            const void *pointer;
            union {
                u8 u8_data[sizeof(u64) / sizeof(u8)];
                u16 u16_data[sizeof(u64) / sizeof(u16)];
                u32 u32_data[sizeof(u64) / sizeof(u32)];
                u64 u64_data[sizeof(u64) / sizeof(u64)];
                const char *str[sizeof(u64) / sizeof(char *)];
            } value;
        };
    };

doesn't end well, as kernel-doc can't properly identify
that u8_data belongs to the "value" named union.

Write a new class using a similar pattern to what we did
for NestedMatch. Here, we opted to use a recursive approach,
as the code is simpler to understand.

This code itself is complex, so add together an unittest
to allow us to exercise it with more complex examples before
switching to it.

It should be noticed that we recently noticed a bug when parsing
a struct_group_tagged() logic that contained a /* private */.

We ended adding a small hack at NestedMatch, making it handle
unmatched blocks.

Here, the logic is more complex, and may have other problems
due to it. So, add a NOTE about it. We'll need to revisit
the parser before start using the new class.
