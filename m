Future Intel CPUS will support Protection Key Supervisor (PKS).

Update the protection key documentation to cover pkeys on supervisor
pages.

+Kernel API for PKS support
+==========================
+
+PKS is intended to harden against unwanted access to kernel pages.  But it does
+not completely restrict access under all conditions.  For example the MSR
+setting is not saved/restored during irqs.  Thus the use of PKS is a mitigation
+strategy rather than a form of strict security.
+
+The following calls are used to allocate, use, and deallocate a pkey which
+defines a 'protection domain' within the kernel.  Setting a pkey value in a
+supervisor mapping adds that mapping to the protection domain.  Then calls can be
+used to enable/disable read and/or write access to all of the pages mapped with
+that key:
+
+        int pks_key_alloc(const char * const pkey_user);
+        #define PAGE_KERNEL_PKEY(pkey)
+        #define _PAGE_KEY(pkey)
+        int pks_update_protection(int pkey, unsigned long protection);
+        void pks_key_free(int pkey);
+
+In-kernel users must be prepared to set PAGE_KERNEL_PKEY() permission in the
+page table entries for the mappings they want to ptorect.
+
+WARNING: It is imperative that callers check for errors from pks_key_alloc()
+because pkeys are a limited resource and so callers should be prepared to work
+without PKS support.
+
+For admins a debugfs interface provides a list of the current keys in use at:
+
+        /sys/kernel/debug/x86/pks_keys_allocated
+
+Some example code can be found in lib/pks/pks_test.c
