In addition to completions, I think this also applies to up()? But I
don't know if that's intentionally supported or just an implementation
detail.

Is there some central place where this should be documented instead of
Documentation/locking/mutex-design.rst as a more general kernel
locking design thing? Maybe Documentation/locking/locktypes.rst?

I think it should also be documented on top of the relevant locking
function(s) though, since I don't think everyone who uses locking
functions necessarily reads the separate documentation files first.
Mutexes kind of stand out as the most common locking type, but I guess
to be consistent, we'd have to put the same comment on functions like
up_read() and up_write()? And maybe drop the "Mutexes are different
from spinlocks in this aspect" part?

(Sidenote: Someone pointed out to me that an additional source of
confusion could be that userspace POSIX mutexes support this usage
pattern.)

I'd say it involves an atomic store-release, but the whole operation
is not atomic. :P

But yeah, I see how this is confusing wording, and I'm not
particularly attached to my specific choice of words.
