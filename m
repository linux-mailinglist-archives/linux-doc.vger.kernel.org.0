Hello,

Back in October 2025, the "locking" support in SPI NOR was discussed on
the mailing list (link below). The conclusion was that this support
could benefit from some enhancements. As I myself had to dig into it,
here is a proposal.

First issue that I see, the MEMLOCK ioctl is not behaving correctly
in some cases, as addressed in:

    mtd: spi-nor: swp: Improve locking user experience

Then there is no clear explanation of the shortcuts taken by the kernel
in terms of uAPI, so there is an attempt to list them in:

    mtd: spi-nor: swp: Explain the MEMLOCK ioctl implementation behaviour

Plus, Tudor also asked if we could cover locking in the testing
procedure, which is done in:

    mtd: spi-nor: Add steps for testing locking support

In order to simplify this procedure, and because it got very helpful
during my testing/development, I want to propose additions to the
debugfs output:

    mtd: spi-nor: debugfs: Add locking support TODO: make the captures again

Finally, I am providing an implementation for the complement (CMP)
feature in order to allow finer control of the regions locked. This
feature is for instance available on Winbond chips:

    [core] mtd: spi-nor: swp: Add support for the complement feature
    [doc]  mtd: spi-nor: Add steps for testing locking with CMP
    [use]  mtd: spi-nor: winbond: Add CMP locking support

Disclaimer: it was much less straightforward than I initially thought to
get the CMP feature working correctly. I tested it with as much focus as
I could, and I am improving the test coverage for the new cases, I am
also providing extra test cases in the metadata of the commit (which do
not make sense to test for chip additions, but may be sensible show when
making core additions like this one), but honestly there are so many
possibilities, I may still be missing corner cases. I hope this will
anyway be helpful to others!

All the other patches are misc improvements or style fixes which I faced
and fixed during my development.

Changes in v6:
- Took most of Sashiko's comments into account:
  https://sashiko.dev/#/patchset/20260507-winbond-v6-18-rc1-spi-nor-swp-v5-0-93453e1a9597%40bootlin.com
  - Fixed a mask ( '|=' instead of '=' ), also reported by Tudor/.
  - The unlock() ioctl was misunderstood, and can actually unlock more,
    whereas I was stating that it could only unlock less. I made further
    tests and fixed the comment.
  - Added an early return in spi_nor_get_locked_range_sr().
  - Enhanced the calculations for selecting CMP mode.
  - Reordered the locking steps to mimic what was done before and make
    sure early returns would not misbehave (corner case).
  - Made sure the SR cache was always initialized (corner case).
  - Made sure new variables were always initialized (corner case).
  - Made sure we were always passing nor->bouncebuf and not some offsets
    inside that buffer, making sure we would always be cache line
    aligned.
  - Changed some loff_t to u64 to mimic the rest of the code and avoid
    casting issues.
  - Moved some variables in the declaration stack.
  - Fixed several typos.
  - Fixed a copy paste error in the documentation.
  - Fixed a flash name in a commit title.
  - Ignored some warnings about possible overflows when the values are
    known to be small.
  - Ignored possible underflows with ilog2() calculations because they
    cannot happen with production devices.
- Reordered two patches.
- Link to v5: https://lore.kernel.org/r/20260507-winbond-v6-18-rc1-spi-nor-swp-v5-0-93453e1a9597@bootlin.com

Changes in v5:
- Fixed the writing of SR2 in the locking ops for devices without RDCR
  capability.
- Moved the ioctl comments to an existing comment as advised by
  Pratyush.
- Changed the documentation to use the concept of lock sector instead of
  block because on small density devices, the two amounts are typically
  different.
- Renamed the debugfs output "#blocks" -> "#sectors" for the same
  reason.
- Added a patch to make sure the QE bit is not badly overwritten when
  using the core's SR/CR status write helpers.
- Link to v4: https://lore.kernel.org/r/20260403-winbond-v6-18-rc1-spi-nor-swp-v4-0-833dab5e7288@bootlin.com

Changes in v4:
- Make sure we don't try to show the (SR specific) debugfs info if the
  chip does not support an SR based locking scheme. For this, add a new
  helper to derive whether we are using the default ops or not.
- Fix compilation issue on arm32, by using div_u64.
- Link to v3: https://lore.kernel.org/r/20260317-winbond-v6-18-rc1-spi-nor-swp-v3-0-2ca9ea4e7b9b@bootlin.com

Changes in v3:
- No change at all, just rebased on top of v7.0-rc1.
- Collected 2 R-by from M. Walle.
- Link to v2: https://lore.kernel.org/r/20260108-winbond-v6-18-rc1-spi-nor-swp-v2-0-c462ef806130@bootlin.com

Changes in v2:
- Collect tags.
- Add missing Fixes/Cc: stable tags.
- Add a comment explaining why can_be_top && can_be_bottom is a specific
  condition.
- Fix commit logs following Michael Walle's reviews.
- Amend the documentation following our discussion with Michael Walle as
  well.
- Cache the SR register for debugfs use.
- Create a locked sector map file instead of dumping it as part of the
  `params` file output.
- Improved greatly the output of the map as suggested by Michael.
- Add a patch fixing a duplicate dependency in Kconfig.
- Add an important comment in the doc about the small 4kiB erase size
  choice.
- Add test runs for each and every chip for which the CMP feature is
  added. This prove me that testing of each and every chip was needed,
  as some of them seem to feature a broken BFPT table which does not
  advertise a working 35h (Read CR) command.
- Added a condition on which the CMP feature is enabled: RDCR must be
  possible.
- Link to v1: https://lore.kernel.org/r/20251114-winbond-v6-18-rc1-spi-nor-swp-v1-0-487bc7129931@bootlin.com
