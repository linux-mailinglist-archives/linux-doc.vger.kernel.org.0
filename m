It doesn't make sense to me to have a partition with no cpu configured 
at all. I very much prefer the users to set cpuset.cpus first before 
turning it into a partition.

No. As I said in the documentation, transitioning from partition root to 
member is allowed. Against, it is illogical to allow a cpuset to become 
a potential partition if it parent is not even a partition root at all. 
In the case that the parent is reverted back to a member, the child 
partitions will stay invalid forever unless the parent become a valid 
partition again.

The original rule is to be based on effective cpus. However, to properly 
handle the case of allowing offlined cpus to be included in the 
partition, I have to change it to cpu_allowed instead. I can certainly 
change it back to effective if you prefer.

This rule is there mainly for ease of implementation. Otherwise, I need 
to add additional code to handle the conversion of child cpusets which 
can be rather complex and require a lot more debugging. This rule will 
no longer apply once the cpuset becomes a partition root.
