No, I just misread the expression.

In this particular case, I would keep it as-is, with the UTF-8 char
on it. I mean, it might be converted to some other symbolic logic
notation, but "MSR 29:31" and "SRR1 29:31" aren't valid names on C.

The title of the session says that it is part of "h/rfid mtmsrd quirk".

Searching for rfid:

	$ git grep -l rfid arch/powerpc/

Shows a lot of asm code. I guess that if the above quirk is still at
the Kernel, it is probably somewhere at the assembler part.

So, it sounds to me that converting it into C (or pseudo-C) won't
make it any better.

Thanks,
Mauro
