Hi Fayçal,

in fact this same IOCTLs based interface (even if more rough) was also present in
the defunct FS approach, attached to the special 'control' files...nothing new
really...but a lot of rework and testing needed for sure...

... of course, since this is the first ever posting with the IOCTLs being
the main and only ABI, it was never meant to be straight away ready for merge,
as I mentioned in the cover-letter there are a few TBD still pending and a
lot of cleanups as reported by the LLM reviews too... Sashiko is one great
example of existing LLM reviewing Kernel patches...

...some of these points are pretty much valid (also Sashiko has a few more
complaints) and I will take care of those....but some other are compeletely
OR slightly off, I will go through those in the following...

I really dont understand this, since the user allocates the buffers, that he
then provides via a __u64 ptr, and such allocation happens based on the maximum
number of items the platform has declared to exist (like num_des) so if the user
itself had lied or mistakenly provided a smaller buffer then declared, that is a
user problem that will trapped and result in a SIGSEGV (or a userspace malloc
corruption)...here a specific reference to the actual code causing the supposed
issue would have helped...

Yes I definitely loop mistakenly on the wrong variable, BUT the missing
check on the too-large condition is an explicit design decision so that
userspace can optionally use the same common big buffer as a scratch
buffer to collect multiple kind of enumeration data...but of course the
loop must happen on the what is available in system NOT on what the user
has passed in...

Beside a bit of hardening, I think here the only missing part is documenting
that you get direct RO access to an SCMI Telemetry area and that you are on
your own in how to parse that...format and lifetime is as specified in SCMIv4.0

Cannot do any deliberate offset handling really...any neeed offset is
dynamically discovered and communicated at runtime via SCMI_TLM_GET_SHMTI_LIST
(offset is rarely different than 0, ONLY if FW has NOT exposed such areas as
page aligned)

..probably worth security wise to check that FW shared areas are
properly page aligned (to the max 64k) and that nothing crititical lays
around when not aligned...so that I dont accidentally expose some other
bits of FW...but I cannot really check so much here from kernel Point of
view...mmm...maybe that the surrounding bytes are zeroed by FW ?

Well the only reason I have NOT implemented this idiom is that all of
this enumeration data is basically static RO (at least within the same
boot), so you can know very well in advance how many elements you have
by calling upfront just one single time SCMI_TLM_GET_INFO, instead of
having to issue twice each IOCTL to know how big the input buffer should
be...but I can implement also this idiomatic form in v6 of course as an
alternative mechanism if we want to support the standard/classic idiom...
...it will be certainly less performant by duplicating all IOCTLs calls x 2...

I will probably rework SCMI_TLM_GET_INFO, to be the new SCMI_TLM_GET_ABI_INFO
including version/capability/resource info IOCTLs...so that you can get the ABI
version, lookup feature bits and get the numebr of resources (like it is
now..to size the requests...)

Yes that is NOT in this version, but it is definitely planned for this
series: there will be a way to read and more importantly some poll
support based on eventfd.

Yes, this is the same as in the FS approach, multiple reader and writers
can coexist BUT the Kernel does NOT mediate concurrent configuration
attempts, last writer wins: kernel only guarantes serialization when
multiple configs are written...but anyway last wins.

Mmm...if SET_ALL_CFG fails midway, an error is reported and the
subsequent GET_ALL_CFG will return the current state of 'ALL':
i.e. True if all enabled, False if any is disabled...

You can anyway lookup each single DE state subsequently.

I could implement an all or nothing with rollback but I am not sure the
complication in code is worth: on the other side I was thinking too about
the optional batched config as mentioned as a way to speed up multiple
configs mostly...

Yes that is the future plan and most of the internal support is already in
place, I have not planned any dedicated IOCTL till now (similarly there was
no dedicated special file in the old FS approach) since, for such streaming
poll model to be feasible, SCMI Telemetry notifications are needed, but they
are optional by the spec and currently NOT planned FW side AFAIK... so I
lowered this in priority and delayed to a future extensions given the
increasingly tight timeline that we have. (even though I can devel and
plan against my emulation setup..)

I would like anyway to add a generic event IOCTL that allows the user to
register a custom eventfd for a specific event to be monitored....first
event being the generation counter change AND second the update
notification for event/poll telemetry ocnsumption....

All of the timestamps are originated by the platform and specified by
the SCMI spec: Kernel does NOT mediate/correct/trim anything here.

It will have to be documented better of course, but all you get is a 64
bit tinestamp and the clock rate in KhZ that has been used to generate
this specific timestamp for this DE..

Can add status.

This was to try to supply some form of tool-independent human readable access
...indeed I was also tempted to re-introduce a limited form of proper SysFs for
global configs like update interval or global tlm_enable...(but not sure
about this really...)

No kernel mediation on this, ONLY a generation counter to spot unexpected
changes.

As of now, no policying, whoever is privileged enough to write to the
device can configure the system, last writer wins.
Being now all of this based on a bunch of single devices (one per instance),
it could be more feasible to enable some sort of optional exclusive open mode
for the first privileged user to get hold of the device...I'll reason about it.

Yes that was minimal on purpose, given this was the first shot and a lot
can still change...

Well...the tool as of now if a draft thing for testing...it is indeed
marked as RFC (and declared in a crappy state)...so it is clear NOT for
upstream as it is: as I mentioned in the commit itself it is meant to be
improved and used for testing in the future...not for upstream in this
state of course...

...BUT even in this state can be used to simply exercise most of the
IOCTL quickly...so that was the reason I included it as  RFC.

Thanks,
Cristian
