See my other email for this one.

Here, too, the real problem is that the kerneldoc comment is in the
wrong place.  There will be a real declaration for that structure
somewhere; in this case it's lib/xz/xz_dec_stream.c.  *That* is where
the kerneldoc comment should be.

That said, the above isn't a kerneldoc comment anyway; it doesn't really
describe anything useful and would generate lots of warnings if it were
in the right place.  The right solution is either (1) write a proper
comment describing this structure, or (2) delete the extra "*" at the
beginning of this comment.

*Please* give an actual example, from the source, of what you are
talking about for cases like this; I spent a while looking at that file
trying to figure out what you were talking about.  I assume you're
referring to silliness like this:

/**
 * struct omap_hwmod_sysc_type2 - TYPE2 sysconfig scheme.
 *
 * To be used by hwmod structure to specify the sysconfig offsets if the
 * device ip is compliant with the new PRCM protocol defined for new
 * OMAP4 IPs.
 */
struct sysc_regbits omap_hwmod_sysc_type2 = {
	.midle_shift	= SYSC_TYPE2_MIDLEMODE_SHIFT,
	.sidle_shift	= SYSC_TYPE2_SIDLEMODE_SHIFT,
	.srst_shift	= SYSC_TYPE2_SOFTRESET_SHIFT,
	.dmadisable_shift = SYSC_TYPE2_DMADISABLE_SHIFT,
};

...right?  Again, the problem here is that these are not proper
kerneldoc comments.  We're not describing the structure, this is just a
comment describing a specific variable.  The right fix, once again, is
s%/**%/*%

>     b) "static __maybe_unused const struct st_sensors_platform_data

Same problem here; the fix is not in the docs build system.

Thanks,
