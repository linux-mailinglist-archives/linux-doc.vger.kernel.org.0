It would be great if we would get this suggestion automatically, e.g.,
via get_maintainers.pl --- maybe that's already done, I didn't check.

Personally, I don't speak/read any Chinese, so I'm mostly lost staring
at the Chinese translation. :)

Yes, these books in particular are still of a lot of value, although
outdated. :)

The difference is that when you translate a book, there is a
date/version attached, meaning, the original book was for example based
on kernel v2.XXX. Once you translate the book, it's simply based on the
same kernel version.

The in-tree doc is similar. You can access the v5.14 doc for example
easily via https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v5.14/. And the Chinese
version via https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v5.14/translations/zh_CN/.

If I as a developer perform a doc update in v5.14, and the translation
isn't updated until the end of the same release, the versioned
documentation will be out of sync. And that happens automatically with a
new release.

With an out-of-tree translation, there wouldn't really be an issue. Once
everything was translated (brought up-to-date), you would mark it has
"fully translated doc of v5.15" manually and release it.

But maybe the translation maintainers already take proper care of
updating any translation just before the new kernel is released.

So just my comment after stumbling over in-tree doc translations.
