Are you volunteering to be a reviewer under drivers/vfio/?  Careful,
I'll add you ;)

What you're saying is true of course and it could be argued that this
sort of criteria is true for any new driver, I think the unique thing
here that raises it to a point where we want to formalize the breadth
of reviews is how significantly lower the bar is to create a device
specific driver now that we have a vfio-pci-core library.  Shameer's
stub driver is 100 LoC.  I also expect that the pool of people willing
to volunteer to be reviewers for PCI related device specific drivers is
large than we might see for arbitrary drivers.

This is what "etc" is for, the owners are involved and have endorsed it
in some way, that's all we care about.  Thanks,
