Yes, the alternative to having GPIOs would be to have pins hard-wired set to a
specific logic level. And the connection don't need to be to GPIOs. The gain
pins on the ADC chip can be connected to anything that keeps a constant logic
level while we capture data from the ADC.

Having some pins hard-wired and some connected to GPIOs is possible, but that
would make things even more complex as each pin on the ADC chip sets a different
portion of the gain. IMHO, mixed GPIO/hard-wired configuration starts looking
like over engineering and I haven't been requested for so much configuration
flexibility. Having either all hard-wired or all connected to GPIOs should be ok.

I'm not familiar with pinctrl dt-bindings, but I was wondering if we could get
to something similar with pinctrl. Based on some pinctrl bindings, I think
fixed-level GPIOs could look like the following (for the 4 pin-mode example).

pinctrl0: pincontroller@0 {
    compatible = "vendor,model-pinctrl";

    all-low-state: some-gpio-pins {
        pins = "gpio0", "gpio1", "gpio2", "gpio3";
        function = "gpio";
        output-low;
    };
    all-high-state: some-gpio-pins {
        pins = "gpio0", "gpio1", "gpio2", "gpio3";
        function = "gpio";
        output-high;
    };
    most-high-state: some-gpio-pins {
        pins1 { 
            pins = "gpio0", "gpio1", "gpio2";
            function = "gpio";
            output-high;
        };
        pins2 { 
            pins = "gpio3";
            function = "gpio";
            output-low;
        };
    };
};
spi {
    adc@0 {
        compatible = "vendor,adc";
        /* All gpios */
        pga-gpios = <&gpio0 0 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>,
                    <&gpio0 1 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>,
                    <&gpio0 2 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>,
                    <&gpio0 3 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;
         /* or all hard-wired */
		pinctrl-names = "minimum-gain", "moderate-gain", "maximum-gain";
		pinctrl-0 = <&all-low-state>, <&most-high-state>, <&all-high-state>;
    };
};

Though, the above is still relying on GPIOs which is not a requirement from
ADC peripheral perspective. Also, if GPIOs are available, one can just provide
them through pga-gpios and have full control over the signal gain with the IIO
driver. It boils down to just telling software what are the logical levels at
two pins on the ADC chip when GPIOs are not provided.

Thanks,
Marcelo
