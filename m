Huh, OK. If that's the case then no need to do it.

Wow, crazy. I think the C preprocessor is one step away from magic.
While I know there are rules for it, I often find the way that it
behaves to be counter-intuitive. I can't say I've followed exactly how
your solution is working, but if it works and is needed then it's OK
w/ me. It might be worth promoting the note to be in the commit
message itself (or even a code comment?) so future people trying to
understand the code will have some chance of stumbling across it...

You might hate this, but one possible other solution would be to make
a custom `mipi_dsi_dual_dcs_write_seq_multi` (lifting it out of the
novatek driver) and then say that the "_func" parameter can't be a
macro. If you did it correctly, it would be a pretty big space savings
too. Unlike how we did it in the novatek driver, I think a proper way
to do it that would save the most space would be:

#define mipi_dsi_dual_dcs_write_seq_multi(ctx, dsi0, dsi1, cmd, seq...) \
  do { \
  static const u8 d[] =3D { cmd, seq }; \
  mipi_dsi_dual_dcs_write_buffer_multi(ctx, dsi0, dsi1, \
                             d, ARRAY_SIZE(d)); \
  } while (0)

...and then mipi_dsi_dual_dcs_write_buffer_multi() would be
implemented in drm_mipi_dsi.c.

With the above implementation, you only have one "static const" buffer
(maybe the compiler is smart enough to combine w/ the novatek code,
but  it might not be) and also only have a single function call taking
up space in the panel driver. You'd only have the "custom" dual
implementation for the "write_seq" stuff since that appears to be the
most common. All the other DSI calls could use the normal
mipi_dsi_dual() macro...

I was thinking of suggesting that as an optional followup to your
series anyway (for the space savings), but it could also solve some of
the preprocessor woes. :-P

I'm certainly not dead-set on this, so if you want to just keep
something like your current solution that's OK w/ me too.

I wasn't thinking of any GNU extensions. Just using a scope-defined
local variable...

#define _mipi_dsi_dual(_func, _dsi1, _dsi2, _ctx, ...) \
  do { \
    struct mipi_dsi_multi_context *__ctx =3D (_ctx); \
    __ctx->dsi =3D (_dsi1); \
    ...

I think it's a rare person who fully understands the dirty corners of
the C preprocessor and I wouldn't count myself as one of them. I can
sometimes make it do what I want, but I think we're up against my
limits too...
