Dmitry, FWIW, we roughly had the exact same of argument with Rob with
i2c-hid :)

It took me a while, but I finally understood the rationale and agreed to
it (using the i2c-hid examples):

Most i2c-hid devices are following the spec and rely purely on ACPI and
the DT declaration of i2c-hid -> they are working fine and we don't need
anything else for them. They declare their compatible and the i2c-hid
compatible, and they work great.

But some devices need a reset line. But the i2c-hid spec doesn't mention
a reset line at all. And some other devices need a reset line with a
different timing. etc... Relying purely on the i2c-hid driver means that
the driver needs to now the platform the device is on and the exact
device we have in front of us. i2c-hid provide a VID/PID through the
protocol, but we are still lacking information: in some cases, the
timing of the reset line for the same device differs depending on the
platform they run.

Having a device specific compatible means that we can make use of it
before we load i2c-hid. This is why we have i2c-hid-core and module
specifics on the side. Those extra module can do all the oddities they
want, like having 2 or 3 reset lines, but in the end they are using the
core i2c-hid once they are set up.

Think of it as a way to quirk the device upfront without polluting the
i2c-hid processing.

That allowed us to clean up the i2c-hid code by removing the non
standard regulators, reset lines, quirks that are device specific and
keep it closer to the spec.

Cheers,
Benjamin
