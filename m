:party-parrot:

Yeah I think the step around integrating into the real man page is an
area that folks may have opinions on and I'm CC'ing Michael here in
particular, but ultimately that manual is currently managed in the
upstream manpages tree so nothing actionable from this series,
absolute simplest is for someone (is that me?) to just package this
hunk up and submit it to the upstream tree every once in a while.
Slightly more elaborate would involve integrating the static text with
this generated text somewhere (either kernel tree or manpages tree)
and have someone run a cron job to generate & submit the changes.
Could be another option, these are the obvious ones that come to mind.
