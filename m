I have this old spf_test
(https://github.com/surenbaghdasaryan/spf_test/blob/main/spf_test.c)
which I often use to weed out vma locking issues because it starts
multiple threads doing mmap + page faults. Perhaps we can repackage it
into a test/benchmark for testing contention on mmap/vma locks?

!

As a starting point I was thinking of changing
vma_assert_attached()/vma_assert_detached() and
vma_mark_attached()/vma_mark_detached() to return a bool and use
WARN_ON_ONCE() (to address your concern about asserts being dependent
on CONFIG_DEBUG_VM) like this:

static inline bool vma_assert_detached()
{
    return !WARN_ON_ONCE(atomic_read(&vma->vm_refcnt));
}

static inline bool vma_mark_attached(struct vm_area_struct *vma)
{
    vma_assert_write_locked(vma);
    if (!vma_assert_detached(vma))
        return false;

    atomic_set(&vma->vm_refcnt, 1);
    return true;
}

With that we can add correctness checks in the tools/testing/vma/vma.c
for different states, for example in the alloc_and_link_vma() we can
check that after vma_link() the vma is indeed attached:

ASSERT_TRUE(vma_assert_attached(vma));

This might not cover all states but is probably a good starting point. WDYT=
?
