> A straightforward usecase of DAMON would be the program behavior analysis.

> Mechanisms of DAMON
> ===================
> 
> 
> Basic Access Check
> ------------------
> 
> DAMON basically reports what pages are how frequently accessed.  The report is
> passed to users in binary format via a ``result file`` which users can set it's
> path.  Note that the frequency is not an absolute number of accesses, but a
> relative frequency among the pages of the target workloads.
> 
> Users can also control the resolution of the reports by setting two time
> intervals, ``sampling interval`` and ``aggregation interval``.  In detail,
> DAMON checks access to each page per ``sampling interval``, aggregates the
> results (counts the number of the accesses to each page), and reports the
> aggregated results per ``aggregation interval``.  For the access check of each
> page, DAMON uses the Accessed bits of PTEs.
> 
> This is thus similar to the previously mentioned periodic access checks based
> mechanisms, which overhead is increasing as the size of the target process
> grows.
> 
> 
> Region Based Sampling
> ---------------------
> 
> To avoid the unbounded increase of the overhead, DAMON groups a number of
> adjacent pages that assumed to have same access frequencies into a region.  As
> long as the assumption (pages in a region have same access frequencies) is
> kept, only one page in the region is required to be checked.  Thus, for each
> ``sampling interval``, DAMON randomly picks one page in each region and clears
> its Accessed bit.  After one more ``sampling interval``, DAMON reads the
> Accessed bit of the page and increases the access frequency of the region if
> the bit has set meanwhile.  Therefore, the monitoring overhead is controllable
> by setting the number of regions.  DAMON allows users to set the minimal and
> maximum number of regions for the trade-off.
> 
> Except the assumption, this is almost same with the above-mentioned
> miniature-like static region based sampling.  In other words, this scheme
> cannot preserve the quality of the output if the assumption is not guaranteed.
> 
> 
> Adaptive Regions Adjustment
> ---------------------------
> 
> At the beginning of the monitoring, DAMON constructs the initial regions by
> evenly splitting the memory mapped address space of the process into the
> user-specified minimal number of regions.  In this initial state, the
> assumption is normally not kept and thus the quality could be low.  To keep the
> assumption as much as possible, DAMON adaptively merges and splits each region.
> For each ``aggregation interval``, it compares the access frequencies of
> adjacent regions and merges those if the frequency difference is small.  Then,
> after it reports and clears the aggregated access frequency of each region, it
> splits each region into two regions if the total number of regions is smaller
> than the half of the user-specified maximum number of regions.
> 
> In this way, DAMON provides its best-effort quality and minimal overhead while
> keeping the bounds users set for their trade-off.
> 
> 
> Applying Dynamic Memory Mappings
> --------------------------------
> 
> Only a number of small parts in the super-huge virtual address space of the
> processes is mapped to physical memory and accessed.  Thus, tracking the
> unmapped address regions is just wasteful.  However, tracking every memory
> mapping change might incur an overhead.  For the reason, DAMON applies the
> dynamic memory mapping changes to the tracking regions only for each of an
> user-specified time interval (``regions update interval``).
