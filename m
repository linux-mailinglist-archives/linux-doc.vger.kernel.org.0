I have a conflict of interests of course, and because of it I disagree.

In a community there are active members and passive ones. It is true 
that
active members need to know English (it is written in the 
documentation).
But passive members are following the development, they are learning 
from it,
they profit from its openness. For these users English could be a 
problem, or
an imposition; nowadays students future is shaped based on the language 
they
study at school (studying German/French/Italian/Spanish does not open 
the
same doors).

I believe that the Linux kernel and many other open source projects 
should
not just help the industry to cut their costs, but they should also play 
a
social role: education, sharing knowledge. Documentation in general, and
translations as well, are part of this second world.

In some cases maintainers have been forced to accept code blindly 
without
quality assurance because they do not own the hardware for which they 
are
accepting patches.

I may agree on this, only if there is an official place where to put 
them,
like:

https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/zh_CN/latest/

Otherwise, a translation on a random git<whatever> service is useless 
because it does
not have visibility/authority.
