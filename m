Please use the regular

   commit 12-char-sha ("powerpc: .......")

notation. These links are horrible.

No. This needs restructuring. The non Intel vendor means vendors which
produce x86 machines (not really clear TBH), but adding these two PPC parts
above and here does not make it any better.

Also this suggest that _ALL_ PowerPC processors are affected as there is
no exception list.

So I suggest to structure this like this:

Affected processors
-------------------

 1) Intel processors

    Move the existing list here

 2) PowerPC processors

    Add some meat

Whether a processor is affected or not...

That commit you referenced added the sysfs output for powerpc. So that
should be documented properly here as well, right?

Please make this clearly visually separated. Just glueing this together is
hard to read.

What about the l1tf boot param? Is it x86 only? If so, then this wants to
be added to the the documentation as well.

What about the guest to host issue on PPC? Not affected or same mitigation
or what?

We really spent a lot of time to write understandable and useful
documentation. Just sprinkling a few powerpc'isms into it is really not
cutting it.

This needs proper structuring so that it's obvious for the intended
audience (administrators, users) which part is applicable to which
architecture or to both. 

Thanks,
