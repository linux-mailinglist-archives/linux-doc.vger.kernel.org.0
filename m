Why? I mean the prefixes are fine, but the main part should be the same as long
as we use the same backend API, no? This is a lib/ code which should be suitable
for many cases, including ABI, I don't see the good reason why we should
deviate from that.

I disagree on this. When we touch printf() stuff, we consider all aspects of
the formatted strings, and not only kernel buffer for some features. One may
use memory buffer for that, one may rely on kernel message.

If it becomes a part of ABI, why not? seq_printf() also uses limited buffer and
may become quite untrivial to handle when it's bigger (see all those special
cases when seq options are defined to custom callbacks).

I think it has a relation. The use of hex_dump_to_buffer() is often to get list
of lines at the end to be formatted (and printed if required), it usually makes
not much sense for a single line as it's easier to open code and rarely
people would seek for an ASCII representation part for a single line.

I don't think you need it. What you need is a crc32 of the content or another hash.
It will be a new function that takes some kind of context, one field of which is
the hash (of the previous data).

Do you want me to take over and show how it should be done? Definitely I can
invest some time into it, but I can't guarantee the quick result though.

People (maintainers) who care about lib/ contents.
Mainly I implied Rasmus, but sometimes others also want to see test cases.

After looking around it seems you are right.

I understand your context here, the problem is that this is universal API.

P.S. You probably want to acquire somebody's else tag from PRINTK/PRINTF
maintainers/reviewers pool.
