Hi Jonathan, Federico,

While I was writing some new docs for something else, I found that
given that citations are global, some translations are overriding the
normal citations.

For instance, on:

  https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/programming-language.html

We have the first link pointing to:

  https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/translations/it_IT/process/programming-language.html#c-language

i.e. the Italian translation; which is clearly not intended. Rather,
it should point to the URL the citation points to.

This may have been my mistake originally, since I wrote the original
file and used citations. Checking now other files around in Docs/, I
see almost nobody uses citations and simply put raw URLs, have a
bottom section on References/Bibliography or use inline hyperlinks.

To be honest, after seeing how citations look in the rendered output,
and given they are global, I think it may be simpler to just use
inline hyperlinks. On the other hand, it is nice to have a common set
of citations (to keep up to date both translations and other
documents). However, if we do this, I guess we need to encourage
people to deal with the Sphinx WARNINGs.

How should we handle this? What should be encouraged for new docs?

Cheers,
Miguel
