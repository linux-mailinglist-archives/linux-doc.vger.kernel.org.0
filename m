Isn't there ? Can't the driver-specific data structure be
reference-counted instead of unconditionally freed at unbind time ?

I recall at least one driver (omap3isp) having a circular resource
issue. The ISP hardware block has the ability to produce a clock for the
camera sensor, and the camera sensor is a resource acquired by the ISP
driver. It's quite rare, but it happens. I would however not reject a
solution that would solve the 99.99% of the problem without addressing
this.

We have this issue because designing resource management is hard. The
decision we made not to pay that cost has now turned into a huge
technical debt. There's no easy way around it, it won't be easier to
solve it correctly today than it was years ago. I don't know when we
will be able to fix the issue, but I know it will happen only when we
decide to face the situation and stop with band-aids.

What I think is the biggest issue at the moment is the lack of
motivation/time/money to address this huge, but I'm hopeful because I
trust the technical expertise of the community.
