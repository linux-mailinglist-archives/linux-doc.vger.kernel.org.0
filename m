    Thanks for working to improve our documentation! Naturally, I have
    some comments, the first of which being to run
    scripts/get_maintainer.pl on your patches to get the list of people
    you should send them to. Then cut-and-paste it rather then typoing
    it by hand :) Dante Strock <dantestrock@hotmail.com> writes:

        Documentation/process/: Change 5.x to 6.x; clarify terms; added
        note. From: Dante Strock <dantestrock@hotmail.com> As a possible
        suggestion, might it be worthwhile adding a terminology section
        specific to each section of the kernel documentation? That way
        developers have a handy reference to refer back to for terms
        they might not understand. ---
        Documentation/process/2.Process.rst: - Changed some instances of
        5.x to 6.x(though kept some instances of 5.x that are used in
        examples). - Clarified the term "rc" in brackets. - Added a
        notice for people installing Git or Mercurial to check their
        distribution repository for the latest version of the software.

    This is backward - the changelog goes above the "---" line, any
    additional comments go below. A bulleted list like the above is a
    good sign that the patch should be split up - patches should do one
    thing.

Hello,


Apologies about the sending of the original email: I had been doing a 
lot of fiddling that morning to get things setup and by the time I sent 
the email, had failed to check the address before sending. I'll keep 
this in mind for next time and will be more diligent. Thank you as well 
for the feedback on my changes. I've taken note of these for future 
reference.

I agree with you on the first point you make about the release numbers. 
I suppose we could remove the example version history entirely so as to 
avoid updating version numbers constantly, or stick with one version 
number(e.g. 6.0, 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, etc.) as an example and keep it that 
way. I thought it would've been good to update it to keep the page 
fresh(as the versions listed were between 2019-2020; we're now in 2025), 
but I can see the point you're making and a rephrase might be better so 
as to avoid constantly changing it.

I've always read and understood "rc" to mean "release candidate" and 
thought it would be good, as a general principle, to clarify what 
abbreviated terms like "rc" meant. If this creates the risk of confusion 
and unnecessary debate, then do not include it. This is partly the 
reason why I suggested a terminology section specific to each section of 
the documentation that could help clarify technical or abbreviated terms 
that readers might not have encountered before. In this case, "rc" is 
not that much of a deal to warrant a place in a terminology section, but 
in other sections of the documentation which can get very technical, it 
may well be worth it.

I see very little mention online of Mercurial either: Git seems to be 
the standard VCS nowadays. It might be wise to simply point people to 
Git only, that way everybody uses the same tools and it streamlines 
development for the whole kernel. As for keeping the software 
up-to-date: I put it in as I've found a lot of mentions online of 
packages in some distribution repos being outdated, though with software 
like Git that is heavily used, this really shouldn't be an issue, but I 
thought it still to be worth noting just in case.

Hope this explains my patch well enough.

Thanks,

Dante
