Btw, I did a quick check here: excluding translations, there are 182
files with UTF-8 chars at next-20210429. It seems that most of them
are on files that got converted from DocBook and html.

Several of them are valid ones: the ones used on names=20
(like G=C3=BCnther, Alc=C3=B4ve, ...).=20

Those should remain as-is.

Several Docbook/html converted documents contain UTF-8 NO-BREAK SPACE=20
and other invisible chars, like the byte order mark (BOM) pointed
by Randy.

Those should be replaced (or removed for non-printable ones).

-

Now, there are other cases where I'm not sure if there's a
consensus:

1. UTF-8 is used where there's an ASCII similar (but with
   a different graph symbol), like:

	- UTF-8 commas;
	- UTF-8 hyphen chars, including the long ones:
	  FIGURE DASH, EN DASH, EM DASH

   IMO, those should also be converted.

2. Some UTF-8 symbols, like:

	- =C2=AE=20
	- =E2=84=A2
	- =C2=B2 - used mainly for I=C2=B2C
	- =E2=80=A6
	- =E2=AC=8D =E2=86=91 =E2=86=93  =20
	- =C2=B5s - used for microsseconds

   I would keep those.

3. There are couple of places which uses UTF-8 graphic characters, like:

        /sys/devices/system/edac/
        =E2=94=9C=E2=94=80=E2=94=80 mc
        =E2=94=82=C2=A0=C2=A0 =E2=94=9C=E2=94=80=E2=94=80 mc0
        =E2=94=82=C2=A0=C2=A0 =E2=94=82=C2=A0=C2=A0 =E2=94=9C=E2=94=80=E2=
=94=80 ce_count
        =E2=94=82=C2=A0=C2=A0 =E2=94=82=C2=A0=C2=A0 =E2=94=9C=E2=94=80=E2=
=94=80 ce_noinfo_count

   This is the normal output of the "tree" command on machines with UTF-8.
   I would keep it.=20

   Yet, iconv converts it into:

        /sys/devices/system/edac/
        +-- mc
        |   +-- mc0
        |   |   +-- ce_count
        |   |   +-- ce_noinfo_count

   which would also be fine. So, replacing those would be no-brain,
   but I probably newer documents will be written using such symbols.=20

   So, I would preserve the UTF-8 graphics characters.

I'm preparing a patchset to address the UTF-8 issues on the top of
today's next, but before posting, it seems reasonable to discuss
what to do with the above cases. Comments?

Thanks,
Mauro
