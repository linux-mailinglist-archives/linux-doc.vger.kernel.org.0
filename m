Easy, just put it wherever there is a hole. I think there's one in 
"config:4-7", but it could be put in config3 or config4:

  /* Old enable timestamp bit for backwards compatibility */
  #define ETM_OPT_TS_old              28
  PMU_FORMAT_ATTR(timestamp,      "config:4-7");

The position of the timestamp field is published and tools read it, so 
as long as we don't change the name of it it works fine.

We only keep the old bit 28 because we know old Perf was buggy and 
didn't read the bit position, but if it wasn't we wouldn't even need to 
do that.

It won't be. Old kernels report a 1 bit field and Perf errors out if you 
try to put a 2 into 1 bit. Very old Perfs just set bit 28 which new and 
old kernels will respect.

No, just a new 4 bit field in a new position.

I really don't think the implementation is complex. We just extend the 
field to 4 bits and make 0 off, max is the lowest rate possible, and 
every other value in between is in between.

That's like any enum, it has multiple meanings for each value. I'd argue 
that two fields for the same thing is more complicated because now this 
won't work out of the box, and it would work if we did 1 field:

   perf record -e cs_etm/ts_level=2/ -- test

There will be no warning, but no timestamps either. You have to specify 
both manually. And the only reason for that awkwardness in the API is 
that we added a new field instead of extending the existing one:

   perf record -e cs_etm/ts_level=2,timestamp/ -- test
