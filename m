Yes, I understand, I am asking if this is a problem in practice. For
this to be a problem we'd need to trigger small writeback requests and
have many memcgs.

Why? The kernel should not return before trying to writeback from all
memcgs. If we scan the first N child memcgs and did not writeback
enough, we should keep going, right?

Not the wrong memcg, it will just go back to the first memcg again,
which should be fine as I mentioned below.

Yes, we can probably just take a ref on the memcg before calling
mem_cgroup_iter(). That being said, I think we can just keep the lock,
see below.

I don't think we should re-implement mem_cgroup_iter() here.

Oh, I did not say anything about the current patch adding contention. I
am suggesting we just keep using the global lock for the per-memcg
cursors, if we keep them.

Right now, without this series, the global lock protects against
concurrent changes to the global cursor from concurrent shrinkers. After
the series, the only added contenders are userspace proactive writeback
threads. Unless you have 10s or 100s of those, it should be fine to keep
a single global lock, right?

Yes, userspace can affect writeback efficiency, but we can split the
lock when it actually causes a problem.

Would using the existing global lock work for your use case? How many
different cgroups can you end up reclaiming from concurrently?
