Is that so? There was a whole long drawn-out saga around the SCMI 
protocol using the Arm MHU mailbox as a set of doorbells for 
shared-memory payloads, but it did eventually get merged as the separate 
arm_mhu_db.c driver, so unless we're talking about some completely 
different notion of "doorbell"... :/

FWIW, if the mailbox API does fit conceptually then it looks like it 
shouldn't be *too* hard to better abstract the DT details in the 
framework itself and allow providers to offer additional means to 
validate channel requests, which might be more productive than inventing 
a whole new thing.

Thanks,
Robin.
