Thanks for improving the docs!  Some nits...

You need to add this to an index.rst file so it becomes part of the docs
build.

This isn't needed, that information is in the git commit history.

Please don't use the "#." notation.  Remember that we want the docs to be
just as readable in plain-text format.  If the enumeration (as opposed to
just bullets) is really needed, it's needed in plain text too.

I'd honestly do without all these code-block directives as well; they
clutter things considerably for little advantage.

This is nearly unreadable in the plain text; please use a normal RST table
for this.

Please stick to the 80-column limit, it really does affect the readability
of the text.

Thanks,
