Ah, you are right. With the possibility of reuse, even a freed VMA
should be kept write-locked until it is unlocked by
mmap_write_unlock(). I think the fix for this is simply to not reset
vma->vm_lock_seq inside vm_area_free(). I'll also need to add a
comment for vm_lock_seq explaining these requirements.
Do you agree that such a change would resolve the issue?
