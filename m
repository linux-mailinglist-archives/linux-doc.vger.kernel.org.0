Hi Michael, thanks for reviewing the patch. Comments below:

I agree I might have gone too much into code details, but I assumed
those were pretty much the elementary and "fixed" parts of the
subsystem, with a slow rate of changes in the fundamental stuff.

If the code is prone to future changes or is outdated it's true we don't
want it mentioned here but leaving this doc as a short intro to virtio
won't add much to what's already available in other resources.

The intention was mostly to illustrate the basic virtio concepts with
the concrete implementation in the kernel. I'll see if I can find a way
to do that without relying so much on specific code fragments.

Ack.

Got it.

According to the QEMU website the official repo lives in gitlab.

Thanks, I didn't see it when searching for the spec.

Cheers,
Ricardo
