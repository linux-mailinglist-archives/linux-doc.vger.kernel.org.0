My suggestion is to first switch to the Python version, and then address
the issues not fixed yet by Sakari's patch at the Python version.

I would very much prefer to use regex eXtended flag (re.X/re.VERBOSE) to
implement any required new expressions with proper comments, but, at least 
on my tests, Python support for it didn't work:

	https://lore.kernel.org/linux-doc/6958d7a5-2403-423d-a0a3-0c43931a7d30@infradead.org/T/#m558bbed6272fe1bd988c53dcca2de9af9a8882d3

Funny enough, it worked when I ran using Python command line interpreter.

Anyway, getting regex explanations can also be done via
https://regex101.com/. I usually test there more complex regular expressions
with existing data, as it helps debugging issues.

Perhaps I did some silly mistake there, so it could be worth investing
some time to check why re.compile() didn't work for  __attribute__((foo)).

We may also implement exceptions using some other ways:

	- special function handlers (there are already two, for
 	  syscalls and trace events);
	- some lexical analyzer ruleset;
	- code.

But, at least for now, I would use regex when possible (if it works,
via re.X).

Thanks,
Mauro
