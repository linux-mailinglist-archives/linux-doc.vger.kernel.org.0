While I don't feel like I have enough skin in the game to make any
demands, I'm definitely not a huge fan of this series still.  I am a
fan of documenting reality, but (to me) trying to mix stuff like this
is just going to be adding needless complexity.  From where I'm
standing, it's a lot more of a pain to specify these types of numbers
in the firmware than it is to specify them in the device tree.  They
are harder to customize per board, harder to spin, and harder to
specify constraints for everything in the system (all heat generators,
all cooling devices, etc).  ...and since we already have a way to
specify this type of thing in the device tree and that's super easy
for people to do, we're going to end up with weird mixes / matches of
numbers coming from different locations and now we've got to figure
out which numbers we can use when and which to ignore.  Ick.

In my opinion the only way to allow for mixing and matching the
bogoWatts and real Watts would be to actually have units and the
ability to provide a conversion factor somewhere.  Presumably that
might give you a chance of mixing and matching if someone wants to
provide some stuff in device tree and get other stuff from the
firmware.  Heck, I guess you could even magically figure out a
conversion factor if someone provides device tree numbers for
something that was already registered in SCMI, assuming all the SCMI
numbers are consistent with each other...
