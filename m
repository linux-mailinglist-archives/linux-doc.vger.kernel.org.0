When something like that happens, please just resend the patch with the
correction applied, rather than forwarding it like this.  That way you
don't force maintainers

Also, while you're at it, a few other things:

 - Please put your full proper name in the signoff line, rather than just
   an account name.

 - The patch should have a diffstat showing what files you have touched;
   "git format-patch" should create that for you.

 - You need to add this file to the relevant index.rst file so that it is
   included in the docs build.

 - There appears to be some white-space damage in the patch; look at the
   code samples in particular.

Could you fix those things up and resubmit, please?

Thanks,

jon
