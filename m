This was taken into an extreme with regards to charsets:

	 "better" should never be translated to "crash" ;-)

It is insane to crash the error log due to a charset issue ;-)

True. The machine's locale shouldn't affect *at all* the produced
documents. See, there's a hole set of non-latin family of charsets
supported on Linux:

	https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/charsets.7.html

Nothing prevents that someone using a machine whose default encoding is
KOI8-R/BIG-5/GB 2312/JIS X 0208/... to use Sphinx to produce=20
UTF-8 [1] documents.

[1] or whatever other output encoding

Ok, the logger may not be able to correctly display certain
chars, but it it be perfectly fine and sane to use //TRANSLIT (or
something similar) in order to do a charset conversion.=20

Even to just print a <?> for all chars that aren't printable at
the logger's output using the charset set by LANG/LC_* is=20
better/saner than crashing.

Thanks,
Mauro
