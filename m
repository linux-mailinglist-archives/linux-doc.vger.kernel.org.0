Meh, there's a lot of pointless boilerplate in here.  These statements hold=
 true
for almost every KVM capability.

Heh, this is technically wrong.  KVM intercepts #AC when the non-virtualize=
d
split-lock detection is enabled, i.e. bus locks will cause VM-Exit, though =
they
won't be forwarded to userspace.

I liked the attempt to capture that this is a threat mitigation, although t=
he
typo probably made that hard to see.

Oof, the existing wording is nonsensical.  This reads like KVM unconditiona=
lly sets
KVM_RUN_X86_BUS_LOCK whenever the capability is enabled.

This is also worded rather weirdly.  It's not so much that VM exits can be
preempted, it's that the CPU can detect a bus lock while also delivering an
unrelated VM exit.

Something like this?

---

This capability allows userspace to force VM exits on bus locks detected in=
 the
guest, irrespective whether or not host has enabled split-lock detection (w=
hich
triggers an #AC exception that KVM intercepts).  This capability is intende=
d to
mitigate attacks where a malicious/buggy guest can exploit bus locks to deg=
rade
the performance of the whole system.=20

If bus lock detection is OFF, KVM doesn't force guest bus locks to VM exit,
although the host kernel's split-lock #AC detection still applies, if enabl=
ed.

If bus lock detection is set to EXIT, KVM enables a CPU feature that ensure=
s
bus locks in the guest trigger a VM exit, and KVM exits to userspace for al=
l
such VM exits, e.g. to allow userspace to throttle the offending guest and/=
or
apply some other policy-based mitigation.  When exiting to userspace, KVM s=
ets
KVM_RUN_X86_BUS_LOCK in vcpu-run->flags, and conditionally sets the exit_re=
ason
to KVM_EXIT_X86_BUS_LOCK.

Note!  Detected bus locks may be coincident with other exits to userspace, =
i.e.
KVM_RUN_X86_BUS_LOCK should be checked regardless of the primary exit reaso=
n if
userspace wants to take action on all detected bus locks.
