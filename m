I absolutely loathe it that there are references to PG_* anywhere
outside page-flags.h.  We have the abstraction layer, we want people
to use it, and we shouldn't needlessly multiply entities by referring
to the implementation of the abstraction.  I remove references to PG_
flags wherever I find them.  I agree that grepping for page/folio flags
doesn't work, and it's something I spend a lot of time thinking about.
In particular, I want to produce decent kernel-doc for them.

I view mm/readahead.c, mm/filemap.c and mm/page-writeback.c as part
of the VFS more than as part of the VM.  But that's something that
reasonable people can disagree on.  I think from the point of view of
the filesystem author, it's all VFS.
