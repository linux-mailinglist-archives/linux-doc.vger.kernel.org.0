NAK.

Again, you've not even bothered checking MAINTAINERS to see who
maintains/reviews swap to cc them, your commit message is cookie-cutter,
and you've demonstrated zero understanding of what you're writing about.

A quick glance suggests the 'documentation' is pointless handwaving
too. This is not worth maintainer time.

Also you've not even bothered to see how patches are sent and so have sent
all these documentation patches separately which SCREAMS 'I just got Claude
to do everything, and maybe I had a cursary glance at it'.

We do NOT want this thanks.

Yeah who cares about page faults around swap, or softleaves (zero mentions)
or data structures or etc. etc.

I mean I won't go on.
