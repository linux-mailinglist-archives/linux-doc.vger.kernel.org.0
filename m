Yeah, fixing it at the chardev (or miscdevice) level would still require
some changes at the driver level (e.g. to wakeup sleeping tasks).

Yes, possibly. 

Miscdevice is a bit of a special case however since you cannot tie the
lifetime of your driver data to that of the miscdev, but there are ways
to address that. And some drivers already handle this (i.e. without any
changes to miscdevice).

But notably the revocable design seems to derive from this quirk of
miscdevice.

[ Side note for completeness: Looking at the cros_ec driver it doesn't
  seem to involve any hotpluggable buses so this looks like a mostly
  theoretical issue of a developer with root access actively unbinding
  an ec-driver while in use. ]

Yes, that's exactly why we always require a user *before* merging
something like this. To be able to determine that the interface is sane.

Now the user showed up on the same day as the merge, which is obviously
not enough time for proper review and discussion.

[ And by short-circuiting the normal process you probably reduce the
motivation for people to spend time on the example conversion too. ]

But we need to look at that before throwing up our hands and saying that
it's not possible and that each driver should take care of this itself.

To the contrary, now is right time to do the revert as there are
fundamental problems with the current interface that will require a
redesign. That's not the kind of work that should be done during an rc
stabilisation cycle.

Give people a chance to see for themselves what the gpiolib conversion
looks like, determine whether this abstraction makes the code more or
less readable, and think about possible further uses of a mechanism like
this.
