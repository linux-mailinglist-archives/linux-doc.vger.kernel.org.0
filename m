Well, that is a valid point. The cpus may have been offlined when a 
partition is being created. I can certainly relent on this check in 
forming a partition. IOW, cpus_allowed can contain some or all offline 
cpus and a valid (some are online) or invalid (all are offline) 
partition can be formed. I can also allow an invalid child partition to 
be formed with an invalid parent partition. However, the cpu exclusivity 
rules will still apply.

Other than that, do you envision any other circumstances where we should 
allow an invalid partition to be formed?

Cheers,
Longman
