Urgh, so that's the munmap() path, but arguably when that fails, the
map stays in place.

I think this means you're marking detached too soon; you should only
mark detached once you reach the point of no return.

That said, once you've reached the point of no return; and are about to
go remove the page-tables, you very much want to ensure a lack of
concurrency.

So perhaps waiting for out-standing readers at this point isn't crazy.

Also, I'm having a very hard time reading this maple tree stuff :/
Afaict vms_gather_munmap_vmas() only adds the VMAs to be removed to a
second tree, it does not in fact unlink them from the mm yet.

AFAICT it's vma_iter_clear_gfp() that actually wipes the vmas from the
mm -- and that being able to fail is mind boggling and I suppose is what
gives rise to much of this insanity :/

Anyway, I would expect remove_vma() to be the one that marks it detached
(it's already unreachable through vma_lookup() at this point) and there
you should wait for concurrent readers to bugger off.

Urgh, I would strongly suggest ditching refcount_t if we go this route.
The thing is; refcount_t should remain a 'simple' straight forward
interface and not allow people to do the wrong thing. Its not meant to
be the kitchen sink -- we have atomic_t for that.

Anyway, the more common scheme at that point is using -1 for 'free', I
think folio->_mapcount uses that even. For that see:
atomic_add_negative*().

That's just weird; why would you not track vma_{start,end}_write() with
the exclusive side of the 'rwsem' dep_map ?

Yeah, so ultimately I think it would be clearer if you explicitly mark
the point where the vma modification is 'done'. But I don't suppose we
have to do that here.
