If there are N versions of the patch with discussion that eventually
lead to the final version that was applied, which one of the previous
patch versions or discussions do you think should be linked to? IMO the
only one that actually is unambiguous is the patch that got applied. IMO
only patches that were submitted to a mailing list should be applied.

I the case of i915, the links will point at patchwork that will also
contain testing results for the patch. It's a paper trail of sorts.

Appears to be on a merge commit with likely manually added Link:
tag. Should be fixed, but hardly evidence of anything really relevant.

Agreed, needs documenting as well.
