Add a few more specific guidelines on handling regressions to the
kernel's two most prominent guides about contributing to Linux, as
developers apparently work with quite different interpretations of what
Linus expects.

Changes like this were asked for during the Maintainers Summit 2024. The
four rules of thumb spelled out are all closely based on statements
Linus made there; LWN documented all except "Expedite fixing regressions
that reached a release deemed for end users.." in their coverage [1].

This removes equivalent paragraphs from a section in
Documentation/process/handling-regressions.rst, which will become mostly
obsolete through this and follow-up changes.

+Handling Regressions
+--------------------
+
+If one of your changes causes a regression, you must fix it, as "*we don't cause
+regressions*" is the first rule of Linux kernel development.
+
+A bug is considered a regression when something that worked fine with one Linux
+kernel works worse or not at all with a newer version.  For a more detailed
+definition, see Documentation/admin-guide/reporting-regressions.rst.
+
+You must fix regressions quickly while applying reasonable care to prevent
+causing another regression.  The balance and thus the appropriate approach
+depends on the situation.  Below rules of thumb serve as a guide.  Be aware that
+maintainers and other developers will take note if you fail to handle regression
+appropriately, especially if they then have to fix the problem themselves: this
+could well make it harder for you to incorporate future changes.
+
+On timing:
+
+ - Expedite fixing regressions that reached releases deemed for end users
+   through new mainline releases or stable backports during the past year.
+
+ - If the culprit was mainlined during the current development cycle and not
+   backported to stable, fix the regression before -rc6.
+
+ - If a proper regression fix is unlikely to become ready in a reasonable
+   timeframe, resolve the regression by reverting the culprit.  This is
+   considered an reputable approach, as it allows working out and merging an
+   improved variant of the change calmly.
+
+On procedure:
+
+ - Regression fixes are not required to spend time in linux-next, but depending
+   on the fix and the alignment with pull requests it might be beneficial to
+   have them in there for a day or two.
