I already had "misunderstanding", here I wanted to express the idea that
people could simply ignore that this file exists (since it's new). Do you
think we shouldn't care about this and just keep "misunderstanding" ?

Ah OK good point, I'll rephrase it.

Sure!

It's still there but maybe not visible enough, I should probably write
it in upper case:

   debugging (e.g., lockdep, KASAN, fault-injection):

Yeah when rereading it now, I fully agree. I think I should avoid the
double negation here and use a form such as;

  * actions performed in user namespace that do not bypass the restrictions
    imposed to the initial user.

If examples are still needed, I could possibly add: "(e.g. ptrace, signals,
FS or device access, system/network configuration, network binding)".

You mean one more paragraph about CONFIG_EXPERIMENTAL ? Or what else do
you have in mind ? Do not hesiate to propose a paragraph if you have
anything in mind!
