"at the same time" doesn't make a lot of sense to me.  CPUs don't do
anything "at the same time".  I think the way this is worded now is
fine; I tried coming up with a few variants of this, but none are as
clear and succinct as what is there now.

Perhaps this could be a little clearer for those of us who aren't as
deep into the memory model as others ... are you saying that the
atomic_set_release() would only order references to obj->refcount and
would not order accesses to obj->key?  Because reading this:

     The use of ACQUIRE and RELEASE operations generally precludes the need
     for other sorts of memory barrier.  In addition, a RELEASE+ACQUIRE pair is
     -not- guaranteed to act as a full memory barrier.  However, after an
     ACQUIRE on a given variable, all memory accesses preceding any prior
     RELEASE on that same variable are guaranteed to be visible.  In other
     words, within a given variable's critical section, all accesses of all
     previous critical sections for that variable are guaranteed to have
     completed.

makes me think that this example is fine; anybody doing a load-acquire
on obj->refcount will see the update to obj->key that happened before
the store-release to obj->refcount.

I am not an expert and would welcome the opportunity to learn more here.
