If you need to link to something elsewhere, you can certainly do so;
there are countless examples in the kernel documentation.

I don't understand those questions.

You wouldn't link to the rendered kernel docs normally, you'd just say
"See Documentation/security/keys/trusted-encrypted.rst".

Look at the Sphinx cheatsheets on the net for the various other ways of
making links if you need to link outside of the kernel docs.

No, there is no such requirement.
