Does this happen if the pte is accessed before the reverse mapping procedur=

finishes updating swapped in pages? I thought this case was being protected
somehow.

We were not able to find any case when is_present(pte) is true when it shou=

have been false, nor vice-versa. Is your previous comment also an example?

That's a good point. Still, the bit can disappear at any time.

I start thinking the same thing. Also considering the implementation, when
tackling shmem pages, the information gets retrieved in a very different wa=
y.

It is clear that private and shared pages, as of their current implementati=
on,
are two very disjoint sets, which need to be reasoned about differently.

Now, my only concern is whether being aware of this difference can/should b=
e=20
the user's job, or whether the kernel is still better suited for handling t=
his layer=20
of abstraction. Because the former would usually mean a significant differe=
nce=20
between operations just to retrieve info that is common to both types of
memory (imagine an interface/class in OOP), whereas the latter could impose=
=20
performance deficits on operations that would only target one type of memor=
y
anyway.

Considering the swap information (offset & type) is already exposed for pri=
vate
pages by the pagemap, I can only comment that not supporting it at all for
shmem seems incomplete IMHO.

I agree pagemap might not be the ideal place for shmem swap info, but an
alternative for information that AFAIK cannot be retrieved in any other way
should be taken into consideration.

That would definitely be more efficient, compared to having to update a
structure in each process every time a page gets soft-dirty. And more accur=
