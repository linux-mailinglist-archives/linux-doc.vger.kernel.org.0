With that reasoning, the "swap.tiers" would serve better than "zswap.writeb=
ack",
do you think so?

Correct, no swap at all.

The first milestone we just implement the reserved keywords without
the custom swap tier list.
That should be very similar to "zswap.writeback". Instead of writing 0
to "zswap.writeback".
You write "zswap" to "swap.tiers". Writing "none" will disable all
swap. Writing "all" will allow all swap devices.
I consider this conceptually cleaner than the "zswap.writeback" =3D=3D 0
will also disable other swap types behavior. "disabled zswap writeback
=3D=3D disable all swap" feels less natural.

Me too. I think we are in agreement here. That is why I think
"swap.tiers" is more general.

If you think we have the risk of not being able to obsolete
"zswap.writeback", then it would be much better not to introduce
"zswap.writeback" in the first place. Just have a minimal
implementation of "swap.tiers" instead. I believe from the code
complexity point of view, the complexity should be very similar.
