No you didn't.

That's all you said.

Perhaps I didn't get your email but this clarification was in no way
shape or form present in your reply on that thread.

I read your patch, and granted, I will accept I was under the incorrect
assumption that this can only be used by networking devices, however it
the devlink approach achieves getting userspace the ability with
iproute2 devlink util to query a device health, on to which we can peg
firmware health. But *this* patch series is not about health status and
letting users query it, its about a *critical* situation which has come up
with firmware requiring me to reboot my system, and the lack of *any*
infrastructure in the kernel today to inform userspace about it.

So say we use netlink to report a critical health situation, how are we
informing userspace with your patch series about requring a reboot?
