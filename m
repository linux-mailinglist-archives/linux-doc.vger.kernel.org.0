Might want to broaden to "the device or possible hot replacements"

I'd write this to allow for RP hotplug as well. Might not be common yet
but who wants to remember to update the doc when that changes :)

Yeah, this is will be bios menu / reflashing the bios stuff or config
files in flash. Similar to happens for the big PCI storage servers with lots
of hotplug ports where we need to make space in PCI enumeration for stuff
that isn't there yet. CXL brings a few extra corner cases but fundamentally
it's a similar problem.

I hope you tidied it up!  That's really ugly :(
