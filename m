NAK for being AI slop, again, obviously.

+cc Mike, the 'boot memory' maintainer, who again I'm sure will be
overjoyed by this.

Reasons, as the rest:
- Worthless documentation
- Everything about patch screams 'zero effort, Claude did it all'
- Bad etiquette

I mean I'm belabouring the point, but this commit message is useless
noise. And it's frankly impolite for you to copy/paste this to every patch.

It's worse etiquette to send them all separately...

Common courtesy would be to take some effort to read the list a bit first to get a sense.

Or even to ask Claude about how commit messages generally look in the
kernel. Or how patch series work. Or who to cc. Or how well sending this
might be received...

You are also demonstrating no understanding of what you're writing about,
and have no track record to suggest you'll stick around to maintain it or
do anything other than dump it on us, get us to completely rewrite for you
and you take the credit...

So IOW, not very useful, nor wanted.

This is at least reasonable.

You're not saying what they are, what reserved mean, why they are separate
etc. - it is typical LLM-generated stuff.

I can't really see any demonstration of you having checked this because
surely you yourself are immediately confused by this?

And etc. etc. etc.
