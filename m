One of the intentions (that may be lost in this conversations) was to
avoid holding the parent inode lock over the entire children iteration in
fsnotify_set_children_dentry_flags().

This function only needs to go over all positive children.
That's why I thought about moving new positive to the end of positives.
Maybe this works if we keep positives at tail and negatives at head
and also have dentry shrinkers work on the negative dentries at the head
first.

Possibly, we can make sure to set DCACHE_FSNOTIFY_PARENT_WATCHED
if needed when making a dentry positive, to avoid some races.

NOTE that DCACHE_FSNOTIFY_PARENT_WATCHED can allow false
positives. It's an optimization flag that is auto cleared with
fsnotify_clear_child_dentry_flag() in case of false positive.

Also, it is possible to set DCACHE_FSNOTIFY_PARENT_WATCHED
*before* dentry is made positive, for example on start_creating()
because whether a negative dentry has DCACHE_FSNOTIFY_PARENT_WATCHED
or not is insignificant.

Thanks,
