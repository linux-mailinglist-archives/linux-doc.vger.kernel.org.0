If all that it is scheduled for Sphinx 6 is the removal of the
old C domain, this shouldn't be a problem. The kernel-doc has
long gone support to output tags with both pre and post v3 syntaxes.

We also changed the automarkup plugin to allow using v3 C domain
tags when compiling against pre-v3.

Tests required, of course.

-

=46rom my side, there are two points to consider when changing
the minimal release:

- Supporting a version that can build docs 2x faster sounds
  very interesting;
- it would also be interesting to support the native Sphinx
  version that comes with the latest LTS releases,
  As I suspect that bots may benefit from a long-term distros,
  and use the distro-provided signed packages on servers.

  Looking at LTS, what we have is:

	- RHEL 9.0/CentOS 9.0:
	  https://centos.pkgs.org/9-stream/centos-crb-x86_64/python3-sphinx-latex-=
3.4.3-7.el9.noarch.rpm.html
	  Sphinx 3.4.3
	- Debian 11:
	  Sphinx 3.4.3
	  https://packages.debian.org/bullseye/python3-sphinx
	- Suse 15 SP4:
	  https://scc.suse.com/packages?name=3DSUSE%20Linux%20Enterprise%20Server&=
version=3D15.4&arch=3Dx86_64&query=3Dpython3-sphinx&module=3D
	  Have have both Sphinx 4.2.0 and Sphinx 2.3.1=09

  From LTS perspective, it sounds doable to setup the minimal
  version to 3.4, but we would need to adjust the scripts to
  select a different package on Suse, as calling:

	./scripts/sphinx-pre-install --no-virtualenv

  Would recommend installing python3-sphinx package there,
  meaning Sphinx 2.3.1.

So, IMO, we have a couple of alternatives:

1. Change minimal requirement to 2.3:
	- No changes required at sphinx-pre-install's logic;
	- all latest LTS will be supported;
	- pdf will still require a newer version than 2.3.
	- allow "fast builds" with Sphinx < 3;

2. Change minimal requirement to 2.4:
	- no need to check for an specific version for PDF;
	- allow "fast builds" using Sphinx < 3;
	- Changes needed at sphinx-pre-install on Suse logic;

3. Change minimal requirement to 3.4:
	- We can drop backward-compatible logic from kernel-doc
	  and automarkup;
	- all latest LTS will be supported;
	- Changes needed at sphinx-pre-install on Suse logic;
	- No "fast build" suing Sphinx < 3.

On a side note, while Kernel documentation builds with 3.0,
it is not really properly supported, as there are troubles
on C domain there (lots of warnings and broken cross references
are generated there). So, I would avoid setting the minimal=20
requirement to 3.0.

Mauro
