NAK.

Because AI slop obviously, please don't send this kind of stuff.

This time I will +cc the page alloc maintainer for you, who I am sure will
be overjoyed by this...

Same reasons as the rest, I'm already annoyed you didn't bother to put this
in a series even. If you didn't lazily get Claude to do everything, you're
doing a very good job at seeming like you did.

Page frames... Which are? And how is that useful

Primary? So what's the secondary, or tertiary, etc.  'interface' for
'obtaining' and 'releasing' (hint: we use other words for these) 'page
frames' (hint: we don't really refer to these as page frames) ?

Nope. Alot are in PCP lists. Claude mentions this below but you're already
hand waving in a way that's actively unhelpful.

This is such a useless abbreviated description of the buddy allocator as to
be frankly worthless.

Ha! You (read; Claude) don't even define what a pageblock is or what it's
for... as if people ought to 'just know', somehow...

Again, you're proactively wasting our time with this, it's not wanted or
helpful.

And etc. etc. etc. the whole document would need to be thrown away and
rewritten, and we could choose to do that ourselves without your 'help',
thanks.
