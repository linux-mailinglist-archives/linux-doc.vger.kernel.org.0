I could be persuaded that it's a good idea, but there are arguments to
be made for not defining them as separate bits:

1. Having two (sets of) bits that mean the same thing means usermode
now has to decide which one to query, or query both. Multiple values
that mean the same thing is always something that makes me nervous.
2. To avoid these two sets having different answers, we'd have to
solve the reverse problem too: If all of the bundled extensions that
make up Zk are on, we'd need to detect that and turn Zk on as well.
That code would also need to know the difference between a pure lasso
like Zk, where you should flip it on if its components are on, and the
loose change variant we were discussing on the other thread (Zvkb?),
where you cannot.

Pretending pure lasso extensions didn't exist on their own was a way
to sidestep the problem.
