I would suppose that one would have to enable editorconfig support
explicitly in one's editor, so this would have no effect for people that
haven't done so (though there are almost certainly exceptions).

I don't think so, not any more than the coding-style document is, and
that seems to be pretty solid (but as doc maintainer, you'd know better).

As someone who regularly needs to submit patches to random upstream
projects to fix bugs or implement minor features, I for one would really
welcome more widespread use of editorconfig. While I mostly work with
the linux kernel (and other projects using the same C style), so my
default C style setting is "linux", even for the kernel this would be
helpful to me when I poke around in none-C files (shell scripts, for
example).
