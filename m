This change is good.

This is arguable.  I would prefer it without the comma.

Again, I don't really see the point of this change.

You're taking "review" as a noun, but if you take it as a verb, the
sentence is gramatically correct.

This change is fine.

Overall, I wouldn't encourage you to send more nitpicking patches
like this.  The cost of review is more than the value of correctness.
By all means correct documentation that's misleading or fix obvious
spelling mistakes, but grammatical errors aren't worth it.
