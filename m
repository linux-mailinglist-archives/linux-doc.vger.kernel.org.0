Even better!  I will take a look, but in the meantime, would you be
interested in updating the wording to explain how the back-pointer works?

(Looks similar to the is_a_nulls() pointer, but in each element instead of
just at the end.  One advantage is the ability to detect a move mid-list,
though that is not a big deal in well-tuned hash tables, which tend to
have short hash chains.  The need to move elements to the front of the
destination list remains, though in both cases only if it has been less
than a grace period since the last move.)
