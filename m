Can you format it how you would like to see it? Should it be a unified
diff? I agree it would help to see "what changed" but also don't know
what you want so opted to provide more information, not less. I was
worried about the questions like "do you change other parts of a splat?"
so I just put the whole thing there.

I'm just matching the build ID API that uses unsigned char. If you want
u8 then we should update more places. I could do that in a followup
patch, but this one is already sorta big.

For typeof_member().
