Yes, this issue is not caused by the kernel, but rather by our 
user-space agent itself.

For instance, suppose a parent memcg has two children, memcg1 and 
memcg2, each with 200MB of zswap (100MB inactive). Triggering proactive 
writeback on the parent memcg will exhaust memcg1's inactive zswap 
pages. After that, even though memcg2 still has plenty of inactive zswap 
pages, it will continue to write back memcg1's active zswap pages. 
Writing back active zswap pages causes the user-space agent to 
prematurely abort the writeback because it detects that certain memcg 
metrics have exceeded predefined thresholds.

Of course, real-world scenarios are much more complex, and this kind of 
case is extremely rare in our environment.

That being said, your suggestion of using the global lock for the 
per-memcg cursors makes the writeback fairer and would resolve these 
corner cases.

Ah yes, sorry about that, I misunderstood what you meant. Thanks a lot 
for the suggestion and for taking the time to explain it so patiently. 
I'll switch to using the global lock in v4 patch.

It should work fine. We typically only have a dozen or so user-space 
agents triggering zswap writeback, and the critical section is very 
short anyway. I will implement this next.
