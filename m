Is there any significant difference between Primary VM and other VMs?

Is the scheduling provided behind the back of the OS or does it require 
cooperation?

After reviewing some of the patches from the series, I'd like to 
understand, what does it provide (and can be provided) to the VMs.

I'd like to understand it first, before going deep into the API issues.

1) The hypervisor provides message queues, doorbells and vCPUs

Each of resources has it's own capability ID.
Why is it called capability? Is it just a misname for the resource ID, 
or has it any other meaning behind? If it is a capability, who is 
capable of what?

At this moment you create allocate two message queues with fixed IDs for 
communication with resource manager. Then you use these message queues 
to organize a console and a pack of tty devices.

What other kinds of services does RM provide to the guest OS?
Do you expect any other drivers to be calling into the RM?

What is the usecase for the doorbells? Who provides doorbells?

You mentioned that the RM generates DT overlays. What kind of 
information goes to the overlay?

My current impression of this series is that you have misused the 
concept of devices. Rather than exporting MSGQs and BELLs as 
gunyah_devices and then using them from other drivers, I'd suggest 
turning them into resources provided by the gunyah driver core. I 
mentioned using the mailbox API for this. Another subsystem that might 
ring the bell for you is the remoteproc, especially the rproc_subdev.

I might be completely wrong about this, but if my in-mind picture of 
Gunyah is correct, I'd have implemented the gunyah core subsytem as 
mailbox provider, RM as a separate platform driver consuming these 
mailboxes and in turn being a remoteproc driver, and consoles as 
remoteproc subdevices.

I can assume that at some point you would like to use Gunyah to boot 
secondary VMs from the primary VM by calling into RM, etc.
Most probably at this moment a VM would be allocated other bells, 
message queues, etc. If this assumption is correct, them the VM can 
become a separate device (remoteproc?) in the Linux device tree.

I might be wrong in any of the assumptions above. Please feel free to 
correct me. We can then think about a better API for your usecase.
