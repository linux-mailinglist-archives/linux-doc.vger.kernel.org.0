What I meant is that I interpret "explicit" as requiring an explicit
mention of permission (e.g. "You can add my tag to the commit"), while
replying to a patch with a tag on a public list seems to me to convey an
implicit permission instead.

Dropping "explicit" seems to be the simplest solution, but the next
sentence mentions "implicit permission" which would then sound weird.

"in a reply to a public list"

This sounds good to me.
