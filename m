Thanks for the documentation. And I love asciiart :)

I'd add this sentence before "The first entry":
A virtual address is split to indexes into every table in the page table
hierarchy.

Maybe something like:

as 0 will point out to physical memory address 0 ...

... typically contain PFN in their high bits and architecture-dependent

I'd add something like

And even architecture specific page table traversals are better off with
using all the levels for better robustness against future changes.
