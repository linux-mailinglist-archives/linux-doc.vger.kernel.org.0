This would definitely help us a lot on sec@k.o, but...

I think it's only 99.9% true. I mean, I've used such tools myself to
find bugs that were not found otherwise and I know that:
  - interactions with the tools count a lot
  - luck counts even more

There remains a faint possibility that the reporter has worked a lot
with their tool to be able to find the problem. I.e. the user helped
the LLM and not the opposite. In this case it might be possible that
it's not public. But clearly from what we've seen over the last few
weeks, the number of duplicates has exploded, with up to 3 reports
for the same issue within 2 days, so it's clear that they're not in
the category I mention above.

Maybe we should leave some rope for "if you are fairly confident that
the work you did is unlikely to have been replicated by anyone else,
the you can report it here" but I think we'll both agree that for now
most reporters really think they did something exceptional while we all
saw it was not the case (or they all do the same exceptional thing).

Thus I'm embarrassed with that.

As you probably guess, I totally agree with these points. I'm just
trying to leave the door open for the rare exceptions without having
to accept all the flood.

Thanks for the feedback.

I'm fine with that but I'd like to add "except..." though I don't know
how to phrase it. If you have any idea, we can write something for a
start and see how it goes. It looks like these tools are pretty good
at swallowing our doc updates to help reporters so the good thing is
that we can now write instructions that are mostly followed in process
docs ;-)
