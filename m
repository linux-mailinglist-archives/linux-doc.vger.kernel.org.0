To determine that you should read the text_offset field from the header
in the Image binary.

That's the *entire* point of having the header -- bootloaders and
scripts should read that, and don't need to know anything about the
kernel source code or build process.

For example, see the aarch64 boot-wrapper:

  https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/mark/boot-wrapper-aarch64.git/commit/?id=4a50f69c550473b989f0d38f096d4d9a3a6804c7

That was never necessary, and never a good idea, because the internals
of the kernel source code can change (as they have now). Bootloaders
and/or scripting should consume the Image header.

If we add that, then we're tacitly saying that people don't need to read
the text_offset field from the header, and we're removing our ability to
ever change that.

I don't think we should add such a statement unless we're certain we'll
never want a non-zero text_offset in future.

As above, reading the header from the Image binary is *exactly* what is
intended.

If that's not clear from the documentation, what do you think would
clarify that?

Mark.
