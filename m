My 2 cents here.

I would keep the default to use more CPUs, as nowadays I suspect that
most devs have a way more than 8GB installed. The worse machine I use
here to build Kernel is a Gen-3 i5 that has has 16GB (and it is a 
personal laptop I bought 5 years ago).

Yet, I agree that doc build should be saner on low-cap machines.

Ideally, the fix should be, IMHO, at sphinx-build: -jauto should
detect OOM possible conditions and reduce the number of used CPUs
it the max available memory is too low.

As there's now a script at Kernel, maybe the script could be modified 
to detect if the max available memory is too low, passing -j1 if,
let's say, the machine has less than (let's say) 16 GB RAM.

That sounds weird. I can't imagine why you would experience system
freeze with doc build. Are you sure this is not your CPU overheating?
