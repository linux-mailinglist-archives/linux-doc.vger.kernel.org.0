Hi Dave,

Essentially, the general rule from Linus is "absolutely no new BUG_ON()
calls ever" -- but I think the consensus in that thread was that there
are corner cases when it comes to unavoidable data corruption/security
issues. And these are rare cases, not the usual case where we'd have
used BUG_ON()/VM_BUG_ON().

Well, I don't make the rules, I document them and share them for general
awareness/comments :) Documenting this is valuable, because there seem
to be quite some different opinions floating around in the community --
and I've been learning different rules from different people over the years.

My question would be what we could add/improve to keep systems with
kdump armed running as expected for end users, that is most probably:

1) don't crash on harmless WARN() that can just be reported and the
   machine will continue running mostly fine without real issues.
2) crash on severe issues (previously BUG) such that we can properly
   capture a system dump via kdump. The restart the machine.

Of course, once one would run into 2), one could try reproducing with
"panic_on_warn" to get a reasonable system dump. But I guess that's not
what enterprise customers expect.


One wild idea (in the cover letter) was to add something new that can be
configured by user space and that expresses that something is more
severe than just some warning that can be recovered easily. But it can
eventually be recovered to keep the system running to some degree. But
still, it's configurable if we want to trigger a panic or let the system
run.

John mentioned PANIC_ON().


What would be your expectation for kdump users under which conditions we
want to trigger kdump and when not?

Regarding panic_on_warn, how often do e.g., RHEL users observe warnings
that we're not able to catch during testing, such that "panic_on_warn"
would be a real no-go?
