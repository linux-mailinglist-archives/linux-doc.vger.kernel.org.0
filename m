IMO there are far too many static functions that use kernel-doc notation.
I certainly don't want to discourage function documentation, but I don't
think there was any ever intent to have those functions added to the
kernel docbooks.

ISTM that there are lots of non-docs developers who either just don't care
about that or never run 'make W=1 htmldocs' to see the problems in their
drivers or subsystems. OK, maybe it's just a very low priority for them.

Willy had a suggestion that we just make checking kernel-doc during
all .c builds a permanent feature instead of a W=1 option.
This helps, but still doesn't force 'make htmldocs' to be run.

And it causes around 450 build warnings in my testing of an x86_64 allmodconfig
build.
