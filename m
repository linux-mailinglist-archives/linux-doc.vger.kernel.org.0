Both English and Italian terms are borrowed from typography, "that thing yo=
u see
on top of your document": the header file. In Italian, we never had a neolo=
gism
for "file", but we have a typography glossary. So it becomes "file di
intestazione". A wider audience can quickly understand where to look to fin=
d the
mentioned "file" because "intestazione" means at the top ("in testa"), like=
 in
English.

As you rightly mentioned, other languages are more alive than Italian and t=
heir
speakers naturally make and use neologisms for the new things popping up in
their lives without scandal. For Italian speakers, these days, it is harder
(already this email shows that I need to justify the use of Italian words i=
n an
Italian document. There are some publications about this problem if you wou=
ld
like to know more). However, I don't think this should be a justification t=
o
forget that terms exist and should be used. I'm well aware of all possible
variants that you can find in Italian original texts (they exist) or
translations ("I file di intestazione", "L'header", "I file header", "L'hea=
der
file"). You wrote that the good one is "header file", but four variants exi=
st
and your rephrase used "file header" (swapped). When I started this work lo=
ng
ago I had to chose an editorial line, and I chose to use Italian terms: (a)=
 when
they exist, (b) they have sufficient diffusion, and (c) if it adds value fo=
r a
wider audience.

For the case at hand, any web search will give you various results using "f=
ile
di intestazione". You can also use Google Books. You might still say that i=
s not
your taste because you prefer English words, but it can't be denied that th=
e
term exists and it is used.

On this particular subject, I think we are a bit off-topic. But if you want=
 to
discuss more we can continue aside.

It is not a literal translation. It is a translation. For example, if there=
 is a
joke inside the documentation, that joke gets translated no matter my opini=
on on
that joke or jokes in technical documents in general. If there are implicit=
,
rather than explicit, references they get translated as such. If the
documentation needs improvement, it must be first done in its original lang=
uage,
and the translation must follow.

>and we have some room to rephrase it while keeping the original meaning in=
tact.

Why not using that room in English as well? For example:

""" From the patch
Feel free to peruse the header files to see what else is already
defined that you shouldn't reproduce in your code.
"""

""" Your suggestion
=C3=88 consigliato consultare i vari file header per vedere altre macro gi=
=C3=A0
disponibili.
"""

This reprhase is not anymore -->friendly<-- inviting users to read the head=
er
files and discover new macros, and it is not reminding them that they shoul=
d do
it to avoid duplicating code, probably incorrect code (the entire intention=
 of
point 18 of the coding style document).

A reprhase for better readability would be greatly appriciated, I'm definiv=
ely
not Dante. In doing so, remember to not delete things or change the tone of=
 the
original text. If that is your intention, then do the same in English.

P.S. I'm interested in the non-translatable terms you found in Italian book=
s. In
the past I was doing some researches on the topic and I'm genuinly curious =
to
see what you found there and see their etymology :)
