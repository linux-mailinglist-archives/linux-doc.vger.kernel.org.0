For example when reclaiming memory, when scanning page tables in
khugepaged, or triggered by user space (note that this is the approach I
originally looked into). But it certainly requires more locking thought
to avoid stopping essentially any page table walker.

It would happen only when actually trigger reclaim of page tables
(again, someone has to trigger it), so it's barely an issue.

For example, khugepaged already scans the page tables either way.

The issue AFAIU is that once your refcount hits 0 (no more references,
no more entries), the longer you wait with reclaim, the longer others
have to wait for populating a fresh page table because the "page table
to be reclaimed" is still stuck around. You'd have to keep the refcount
increased for a while, and only drop it after a while. But when? And
how? IMHO it's not trivial, but maybe there is an easy way to achieve it.
