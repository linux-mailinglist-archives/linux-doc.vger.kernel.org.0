The kernel code should not do this.

Scattering the elements of the same CONFIG option
results in unreadable, unmaintainable code.


Kconfig supports it, but the actual implementation is incorrect,
and the behaviour is obscure.

The dependency of a symbol and the visibility of a prompt
are two different things.


Each symbol does track its dependency, so called "direct dependency".
(symbol::dir_dep)


Prompts can have separate visibility.




This is "show by example".



config X86_VSYSCALL_EMULATION
        bool "Enable vsyscall emulation" if EXPERT
        default y
        depends on X86_64




When X86_64=3Dn, X86_VSYSCALL is disabled.


When EXPERT=3Dn, the prompt becomes invisible,
but the symbol itself can be enabled.
X86_VSYSCALL_EMULATION is always y
due to 'default y'.

I do not want to advertise this because
there is no beneficial case for doing this.
