Not active. We enable CONFIG_DMA_NONCOHERENT_CACHE_SYNC for ARM64,
given the directions received back in April when discussing the
noncoherent memory functionality on the mailing list in the thread I
pointed out in my previous message and no clarification on why it is
disabled for ARM64 in upstream, despite making several attempts to get
some.

I guess it means that we're wildly misusing the API, but it still does
work. Could you explain how it could break other drivers?

That's not how I read his reply from the thread I pointed to, but that
might of course be my misunderstanding.

No, there is no overlap between vb2-dc and vb2-sg. They differ on
another level - the former is to be used by devices without
scatter-gather or internal mapping capabilities and gives the driver a
single DMA address for the whole buffer, regardless of whether it's
IOVA-contiguous (for devices behind an IOMMU) or physically contiguous
(for the others), while the latter gives the driver an sgtable, which
of course may be DMA-contiguous internally, but doesn't have to and
usually isn't. This model makes it possible to hide the SoC
implementation details from particular drivers, since those are very
often reused on many SoCs which differ in the availability of IOMMU,
DMA addressing restrictions and so on.

Best regards,
Tomasz
