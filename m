Hmm, clearing the screen without any (atomic) modesets being initiated by either
an in kernel drm-client or userspace seems wrong, this is certainly different from
what the i915 driver does. The way I see it either a drm client provides a new
framebuffer in which case you copy that over the old contents, effectively clearing
it. Or a drm-client gets a handle and draws to the current fb directly, in which
case it is the clients responsibility to clear it itself first.

IOW I believe that simpledrm should not clear the screen itself at all.

Regards,

Hans
