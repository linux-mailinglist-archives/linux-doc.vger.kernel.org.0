As already mentioned, I went with your advice to just take the maple 
tree's internal spinlock within the GPUVA manager and leave all the 
other locking to the drivers as intended.

However, I run into the case that lockdep shouts at me for not taking 
the spinlock before calling mas_find() in the iterator macros.

Now, I definitely don't want to let the drivers take the maple tree's 
spinlock before they use the iterator macro. Of course, drivers 
shouldn't even know about the underlying maple tree of the GPUVA manager.

One way to make lockdep happy in this case seems to be taking the 
spinlock right before mas_find() and drop it right after for each iteration.

What do you advice to do in this case?

Thanks,
Danilo
