Thanks for working to improve the documentation!  I do have a couple of
requests, though...

 - Please send patches inline, rather than as attachments; that makes
   them much easier to review.

 - Please work against docs-next and look at the history of what you are
   working on. For example:

This is not a correct fix; those files have been renamed, not removed.
There is a (correct) fix in docs-next, and has been for some weeks now.

If you could please review the rest of your patch and resubmit against
docs-next, I would appreciate it.

Many thanks,

jon
