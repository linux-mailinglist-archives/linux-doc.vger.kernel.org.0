That's fine. 

I hope in the context of the rest of the doc the new section makes
sense. The doc is aimed at less upstream-savvy driver maintainers.
The section before says "you must respond to bug reports" and the
section after says "the person selected as maintainer should be a
developer not a manager".

I hope when reading in that context it is fairly clear that these are
not "rules of Linux". More pointing out where folks more familiar with
corporate environment get tripped up.

I was planning to add this guidance to maintainer-netdev, but folks
pushed back saying that the guidance is generally applicable.

I semi-quoted some example situation we're aiming at here:
