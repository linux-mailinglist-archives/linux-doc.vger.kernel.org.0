I spent some time today attempting to implement this.
Here's a branch on github that compiles, and I think is close to what you
described, but is definitely still a WIP:

https://github.com/torvalds/linux/compare/master...dfinkel:linux:memcg2_mem=
ory_peak_fd_session

Since there seems to be significant agreement that this approach is better
long-term as a kernel interface, if that continues, I can factor out some o=
f
the changes so it supports both memory.peak and memory.swap.peak,
fix the tests, and clean up any style issues tomorrow.

Also, If there are opinions on whether the cgroup_lock is a reasonable way
of handling this synchronization, or if I should add a more appropriate spi=
nlock
or mutex onto either the pagecounter or the memcg, I'm all ears.

(I can mail the WIP change as-is if that's prefered to github)
