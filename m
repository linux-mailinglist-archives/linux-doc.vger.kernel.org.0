There are lots of place already using :doc: directive, on both
relative and absolute ways:

	$ git grep ':doc:'|wc -l
	382

Replacing all of them to :ref: will be painful. Also, IMHO, :doc: fits
better on most needs, as it makes easier for people working with
just plain texts to find to what file a ref points.

Btw, not sure why, but, when doing some conversions I got broken
references when using :ref:. So, I ended using :doc: instead.

Yeah, interphinx would help a lot to solve broken references.

Not sure, however, if it is worth using it (at least for html).

I mean, IMHO, the big reason why someone would use SPHINXDIRS is to
speedup the process of testing if a documentation patch did the right
thing.

Anyway, it is up to Jon to decide about enabling intersphinx or not.

Hmm... I remember I tried that. It worked now on my local machine.

Yet, the big issue here is that we can't ensure that developers
will always use relative paths. We need somehow convince Sphinx to
always use a fixed base path (/Documentation), even when building
part of a big document.

This is not needed. Probably because both conf.py and Makefile
passes a kerneldoc source directory:

	$ grep kerneldoc_ Documentation/conf.py
	kerneldoc_bin = '../scripts/kernel-doc'
	kerneldoc_srctree = '..'
	$ grep kerneldoc_ Documentation/Makefile 
	KERNELDOC_CONF  = -D kerneldoc_srctree=$(srctree) -D kerneldoc_bin=$(KERNELDOC)
