Subject: [PATCH] docs: arm: Fix RAM offset requirement for loading a raw image

Commit 83d26d1113d8 ("ARM: 7824/1: update advice on kernel, initramfs and
FDT load address.") changed the offset requirement for loading a raw kernel
image into RAM from 32KiB (0x8000) to TEXT_OFFSET - PAGE_OFFSET, which
results in a negative value. Change the offset to be TEXT_OFFSET, which has
an arch dependent value between 0x8000 and 0x308000.

 When booting a raw (non-zImage) kernel the constraints are tighter.
