Thanks for writing this with your characteristic blend of self-deprecating
humour and supportive advice.  One thing which I feel should be mentioned
is the hard work put in by hundreds of kernel maintainers who have
written kernel-doc and nobody has done the trivial work to actually
include those source files in an rst file, so all that documentation
is being ignored.  A great task that's a step up from "fixing typos" is
"find documentation that's not currently in a kernel book and add it".
Even if it's just dumped into a "misc" section, having (eg) kvmalloc()
documentation in a kernel book is a benefit.

Do you want to preemptively mention the Oxford comma here?
