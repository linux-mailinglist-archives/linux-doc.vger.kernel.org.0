I'm just repeating things already said, and this is getting
ridiculous.  TILERELEASE isn't needed for an AMX application to run
properly -- it's needed for the rest of the system to run properly, at
least according to Intel's published docs.  Quoting the current ISE
document:

3.3 RECOMMENDATIONS FOR SYSTEM SOFTWARE

System software may disable use of Intel AMX by clearing XCR0[18:17],
by clearing CR4.OSXSAVE, or by setting
IA32_XFD[18]. It is recommended that system software initialize AMX
state (e.g., by executing TILERELEASE)
before doing so. This is because maintaining AMX state in a
non-initialized state may have negative power and
performance implications.

Since you reviewed the patch set, I assume you are familiar with how
Linux manages XSTATE.  Linux does *not* eagerly load XSTATE on context
switch.  Instead, Linux loads XSTATE when the kernel needs it loaded
or before executing user code.  This means that the kernel can (and
does, and it's a performance win) execute kernel thread code and/or go
idle, *including long-term deep idle*, with user XSTATE loaded.

This is nuts.  The ABI is ALREADY BROKEN.  How does picking a random
number quantifying additional breakage help?  We do not have a good
design for AVX-512 in Linux, we don't have a good design for AMX in
Linux, and we absolutely don't have a good design for the secret
feature we don't know about yet in Linux.
