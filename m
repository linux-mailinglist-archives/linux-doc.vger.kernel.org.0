So 6.18? 6.12?

Looking at the history of 3c59x.c i see:

    3c59x: Fix shared IRQ handling

So it looks like it was been pretty stable since 2016.

Could you live with v6.18, which has an expected EOL of December 2028?
If you are only updating once per year, security is not an issue, you
just want stability.

In fact, you might actually find stability starts going down in the
next couple of years, maybe sooner. What we expect to happen soon is a
lot more AI generated 'bug fixes', probably from newbies who are
unable to evaluate if the AI is generated good fixes or bad fixes, or
fixes which are theoretical rather than actual bugs etc. We netdev
Maintainers are already seeing the number of patches going up, and are
expecting to get overloaded. Which means quality will go down. We have
also seen the AI generated fixes are indiscriminate, neither the AI,
nor the human, care, or even look, to see if the driver is from the
last century. We Maintainers however would prefer spending our time on
drivers from the last ten years, maybe newer. So patches for these
older drivers is going to get less review, and bad patches will slip
through.

By dropping them for the current HEAD, we are reducing our surface
area. It will be interesting to see if the AI patches are only for
HEAD, or they start going back to older kernels to find 'bugs'.

However, just because a driver has gone from HEAD, it does not really
prevent us from taking patches for stable. But we Maintainers want to
avoid doing the triage work, figuring out good from bad.

We have not discussed it as a Maintainer team, but one thing which
might work is we add a entry for 3c59x.c in MAINTAINERS, in stable,
pointing to you. You can then validate patches, and tell us if they
are O.K. to queue for stable.
