FWIW, it's easy for me to script this, if there is consensus that a bug that
hasn't seen any activity for longer than N months should be auto-closed with
some apologetic comment like:

    This bug has aged out and will be auto-closed. Sorry that it didn't work out.

    If this issue is still present in recent kernel releases, you may need to
    reach out directly to subsystem maintainers in order to get their attention
    regarding this problem.

    Please do not re-open this bug without the above step, as it will simply
    get auto-closed again in the future.

Well, it's *possible* that someone comes across that bug during their research
and adds enough additional information to get it fixed. However, this is
extremely unlikely and it's better to just open a new bug anyway.

I haven't seen any specific change like that. One good thing about bugzilla is
that people who do file bugs have already overcome significant barriers to
sign up and navigate the quaint, decades-old bugzilla interface -- so their
bug reports tend to be generally well-written.
