Subject to usual maintainability vs performance questions sure.
Given we are the ones with the implementation, it's perhaps up to us
to prove the added complexity for a given optimization is worth the hassle
(maybe leaning on Arm to help out ;)  We have some activity going on
around this, but are unfortunately not ready to share.

My work here is done ;)

Obviously I'd want perf numbers to justify it (working on that) but I'd like
to keep on the table the option of patch 5 being the only part that is dependent
on being non conflict aborting hardware. I think even that is a performance
question rather than a correctness one - it simply widens the window in which
we might see a fault and have to dump the TLB. (I may well have missed something
though).

As a side note on that last patch, it is easy to conceive of a BBML2
solution that doesn't do conflict aborts, but for which it is still a performance
nightmare to not flush. As a fictional implementation, where our CPUs get a conflict
abort, we could instead have stalled the core and pushed the abort info to a management
controller, and flushed the whole TLB to resolve (plus probably the CPU pipeline).
If sufficiently rare that's not a totally stupid implementation (subject to some
optimizations). It is basically offloading what we are going to do in software on
a conflict abort with somewhat similar performance cost making widening the window
a very bad idea.

So the proposed allow list might need to be rather more nuanced than "can we get
a fault?"  We all love per uarch performance related opt ins.
