While working on NAND issues, I used print_hex_dump() a lot to compare
data. But I am mostly working on embedded systems where the kernel
messages go through a serial console. Sometimes network support is an
option, sometimes not. Anyway, I often print buffers both in kernel
space and user space to compare them, and they may be full of 0's or
1's, which means lines are repeated a lot in the output and this is slow
*and* hard to compare.

I initially hacked into lib/hexdump.c for my own purpose and just
discarded all the other users, but it felt like this might be a useful
feature for others and decided to make it a public patch.

* First patch changes the "ascii" parameter into a "flags" variable now
  accepting the value: DUMP_FLAG_ASCII.
* Second patch adds a new flag to skip the identical lines, because this
  must be an opt-in parameter, I guess.

The patch series has successfully gone through a round of
kernel-test-robot.

The Cc-list, as provided by get_maintainers.pl, was returning 330
e-mail addresses which felt to much, so I ran the script only on the
second patch (the printk/includes/debug/Doc changes). It gave this
Cc-list which sounds more reasonable. Hopefully this is a smart move,
otherwise let me know what you think would be best.

Changes in v2:
- Rebased on v6.13-rc1.
- Manually fixed the diff in many places to fit Andy's requests.
- Added a real life example (code diff and output diff) with the
  modification of the API as well as the use of the new flag introduced
  by this series in the cover letter (at the bottom) as requested by
  Andy.
- Link to v1: https://lore.kernel.org/r/20240826162416.74501-1-miquel.raynal@bootlin.com

Here is a typical diff showing the code change with a perfectly equivalent
output:

 print_hex_dump_debug("", DUMP_PREFIX_OFFSET, 32, 1, spinand->databuf, mtd->writesize,
-                     false);
+                     0);

Here is a typical output of a NAND buffer without the new 'skip' flag,
ie. with the above code snippet:

And with the new flag added the code looks like this:

 print_hex_dump_debug("", DUMP_PREFIX_OFFSET, 32, 1, spinand->databuf, mtd->writesize,
-                     0);
+                     DUMP_FLAG_SKIP_IDENTICAL_LINES);

And the output is easier to parse and also faster to show on a serial
console:

00000000: 55 42 49 23 01 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 01 00 00 08 00 00 00 10 00 2b 10 f1 92 00 00 00 00
