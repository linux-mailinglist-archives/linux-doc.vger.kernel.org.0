Yeah. But fidelity could not solve all problems, sometimes, word by word 
translation make the sentences and names incomprehensible and very strange.
For Chinese, one need to eat the texts, chew them up, and then spit them out.
If the mean is incomprehensible, then the translation is meaningless.

This chapter aims to post your early plan to community, not only the patch.
Even if it's a patch, usually email only says "发送", not "邮寄".

only need to read (2)

One discouraging thing which can happen at this stage is not a hostile
reaction, but, instead, little or no reaction at all.  The sad truth of the
matter is (1) kernel developers tend to be busy, (2) there is no shortage
of people with grand plans and little code (or even prospect of code) to
back them up, and (3) nobody is obligated to review or comment on ideas
posted by others.  Beyond that, high-level designs often hide problems
which are only revealed when somebody actually tries to implement those
designs; for that reason, kernel developers would rather see the code.

Please read the original document *carefully*. 
The meaning of the translation here is completely wrong, even contrary.
The fidelity is clearly not appropriate here.
==
As a result, there is a substantial amount of code in the kernel
which does not meet the coding style guidelines.  The presence of that code
leads to two independent hazards for kernel developers.

The first of these is to believe that the kernel coding standards do not
matter and are not enforced.  The truth of the matter is that adding new
code to the kernel is very difficult if that code is not coded according to
the standard; many developers will request that the code be reformatted
before they will even review it.  A code base as large as the kernel
requires some uniformity of code to make it possible for developers to
quickly understand any part of it.  So there is no longer room for
strangely-formatted code.

Only one word.
==
Note that you can also use the ``clang-format`` tool to help you with
these rules, to quickly re-format parts of your code automatically,
and to review full files in order to spot coding style mistakes,
typos and possible improvements. It is also handy for sorting ``#includes``,
for aligning variables/macros, for reflowing text and other similar tasks.
See the file :ref:`Documentation/process/clang-format.rst <clangformat>`
for more details.
