Let me try for a moment to revive this old thread.

Tha series proposed a new sysctl know to implement a global/default rps
mask applying to all the network devices as a way to simplify some RT
setups. It has been rejected as the required task is doable in user-
space.

Currently the orchestration infrastructure does that, setting the per
device, per queue rps mask and CPU isolation.

The above leads to a side problem: when there are lot of netns/devices
with several queues, even a reasonably optimized user-space solution
takes a relevant amount of time to traverse the relevant sysfs dirs and
do I/O on them. Overall the additional time required is very
measurable, easily ranging in seconds.

The default_rps_mask would basically kill that overhead.

Is the above a suitable use case?

Thanks,

Paolo
