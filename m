Hi Ken,

Please use Reply-to-All instead of just replying to the mailing list.
This is common Linux development etiquette.

IMO it's hard to say without knowing how they are split up or how
inter-related they are.

Not necessarily.

We don't restrict filenames from changing. If one of more change, they will just generate
document build warnings or errors. Someone should see that during the kernel development process
and fix it up. It happens. It's not a big deal.
(This is for in-the-kernel-tree linking. For links from outside the kernel tree,
that's their business...)

We don't have such a requirement, but you can impose one on the files that you are
writing if you want to.
