As I said here on the RFC patch from Sakari:
https://lore.kernel.org/all/aa94772b-7010-4bba-b099-d3b8fe1b97aa@infradead.org/

"Yet another kernel-doc bug. I have a list of 5 or 6 or 8 bugs that are
similar to this one, but I didn't have this one."

The patch to report Excess struct or union members has unearthed several
kernel-doc "parsing" problems.

I have not tried to fix any of these in scripts/kernel-doc yet. I might get
around to it, but it's not a high priority for me.


Examples:

1) drivers/slimbus/stream.c:49: warning: Excess struct member 'segdist_codes' description in 'segdist_code'

struct declaration and definition together. Also possible that the leading "static const"
confuses scripts/kernel-doc.

2) include/linux/spi/spi.h:246: warning: Function parameter or struct member 'cs_index_mask:SPI_CS_CNT_MAX' not described in 'spi_device'
include/linux/spi/spi.h:246: warning: Excess struct member 'cs_index_mask' description in 'spi_device'

scripts/kernel-doc handles some bit fields in structs successfully, so something is
different about this one.

3) fs/ntfs/compress.c:24: warning: cannot understand function prototype: 'typedef enum '

fs/ntfs/* has been removed in linux-next (still in mainline for a little while), but this
shows that scripts/kernel-doc does not handle a 'typedef enum' successfully.

4) drivers/misc/vmw_balloon.c:260: warning: Excess struct member 'reserved' description in 'vmballoon_batch_entry'

This may be the same problem as #2, with using bit fields in a struct.

5) drivers/base/power/runtime.c:362: warning: Excess function parameter 'dev' description in '__rpm_callback'

Confused by either the first function parameter (a function pointer) or the trailing
__releases() and __acquires() attributes.

6) drivers/md/bcache/request.c:309: warning: expecting prototype for bch_data_insert(). Prototype was for CLOSURE_CALLBACK() instead

and
fs/bcachefs/io_write.c:1558: warning: expecting prototype for bch2_write(). Prototype was for CLOSURE_CALLBACK() instead

CLOSURE_CALLBACK() and function parameters are confusing scripts/kernel-doc.

7) drivers/iio/adc/at91-sama5d2_adc.c:471: warning: Excess struct member 'adc_channels' description in 'at91_adc_platform'

Fixed by Sakari's patch.  :)

8) drivers/pci/controller/pcie-iproc-msi.c:110: warning: Excess struct member 'reg_offsets' description in 'iproc_msi'

Fixed by Sakari's patch.  :)

9) drivers/usb/gadget/udc/pch_udc.c:361: warning: Excess struct member 'stall' description in 'pch_udc_dev'
pch_udc.c:361: warning: Excess struct member 'prot_stall' description in 'pch_udc_dev'
pch_udc.c:361: warning: Excess struct member 'registered' description in 'pch_udc_dev'
pch_udc.c:361: warning: Excess struct member 'suspended' description in 'pch_udc_dev'
pch_udc.c:361: warning: Excess struct member 'connected' description in 'pch_udc_dev'
pch_udc.c:361: warning: Excess struct member 'vbus_session' description in 'pch_udc_dev'
pch_udc.c:361: warning: Excess struct member 'set_cfg_not_acked' description in 'pch_udc_dev'
pch_udc.c:361: warning: Excess struct member 'waiting_zlp_ack' description in 'pch_udc_dev'

All of these except @registered (which is just an Excess description) are declared with one
'unsigned' followed by a list of bit fields, which isn't kernel coding style but it is valid C.
or it might just be 'unsigned' without having a following 'int' that is the problem. I don't
know -- haven't looked yet.

10) Matthew Wilcox pointed out to me that commit 0d55d48b19ff is causing problems with
generated output. A few instances of using TAB or multiple spaces have been patched
recently, but there are others that are not being addressed. I don't have a list of these.


I don't know anything about tree-sitter, so if I were going to add a parser, I would
probably (foolishly?) first try using sparse and a sparse extension.

cheers.
