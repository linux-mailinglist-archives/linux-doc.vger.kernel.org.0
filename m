I noticed that too. I suppose we should. Though I suppose that could
give weird results if userspace is expecting LBR. Adding that would
make record_lbr.sh run and then the LBR callgraph test is going to
fail.

I'll have to test that. x86 has SYSRET for "syscall return". We added
ERET which maps to x86 interrupt return. So I guess x86 only records
syscalls and their returns. There's also "sw interrupt" on x86 which
gets mapped to PERF_BR_UNKNOWN. I don't think there's any way for us
to distinguish a syscall return from any other exception return.

If I was designing the interface, I would make PERF_BR_IRQ separately
controllable. But we're kind of stuck with what x86 did. I suppose we
could add a negative 'noirq' option.

Are you of the opinion that we should enable everything or some subset
of them? There's basically inst/data/algn faults, FIQ, SError, and
debug. The debug ones seem questionable to me, or at least ones you'd
want to opt-in for. For FIQ, if that's used by secure world, do we
want non-secure world recording when FIQs happen? Could the timing of
those be used maliciously?

Fair enough. I think we need Mark to chime in here. He was questioning
the need for these.
