I extracted -- from your kind and loving feedback :) -- a number of
specific concerns you seem to have about this proposal:

- You don't like the additional ..._sz set of helpers.
- Alignment isn't taken into account.
- You found the ...set_flex_counter() usage unreadable.

To me, it seems like the primary issue with this patch is that it
probably needs to be at least 2 patches if not more, where we can
iterate on each aspect.

The area of _agreement_, I think, is that type-based allocation is
a good idea. You even recently used it as an example in an unrelated
thread[1] discussing variable declarations in the middle of functions,
and used (a form of) this API proposal, which I whole-heartedly agree
with. i.e. that once we have type-based allocators, we can do things like:

  __auto_type var = alloc_obj(struct whatever, gfp);

So, taking each issue in turn...

(Size calculation)

The benefit is not that it is done in one line, but rather than the size
calculations (which there is no exception handling for) gets built into
the allocation so that wrapping and truncations get communicated back
to the caller in the only way we have available: returning NULL from
the allocation.

I'm not sure what you mean by "limit to pre-defined size". There's no
such design in those helpers, except from the perspective of "detect
and refuse to truncate overflows into too-small storage". Is that what
you meant?

The persistent problem we have over and over in Linux is the lack of
feedback from overflowed arithmetic. This is being worked on[2] at the
same time, but I'm trying to find a way that we can get at "normal"
error handling, since just exploding if an overflow happens isn't a very
friendly way to deal with such conditions, but C doesn't give us much to
work with. If it's _part_ of the allocation, though, we have a natural
way to say "but you can't store 1024 into a u8".

For code like:

	u8 size;
	...
	size = struct_size(ptr, flex_member, count);
	ptr = kmalloc(size, gfp);

While struct_size() is designed to deal with overflows beyond SIZE_MAX,
it can't do anything about truncation of its return value since it has
no visibility into the lvalue type. So this code pattern happily
truncates, allocates too little memory, and then usually does stuff like
runs a for-loop based on "count" instead of "size" and walks right off
the end of the heap allocation, clobbering whatever follows it.

If we have a clean way to build the size into the allocation, then we
can report back a NULL allocation when something goes wrong with the
calculation or the storage of the calculation.

Now, an alternative could be to keep the allocation and the size reporting
separate with some kind of __must_check "give me the size of this thing"
function, but I don't really like this because it feels much less
ergonomic to me:

	u8 size;
	...
	__auto_type ptr = kmalloc_flex(struct whatever, counter, count, gfp);
	if (flex_size(ptr, counter, &size)) {
		kfree(ptr);
		return -EINVAL;
	}

(Alignment)

Sure, but that's the whole point of trying to switch to type-based
allocation: so that we CAN get at the alignment. That would be a "next
step" approach in my mind, since we could bucketize allocations by type
(or alignment), instead of by size. But that's more of a follow-on, in
my opinion. I'd like to get some agreement on the exposed interface for
this API first, and then move to enhancing the internals to take
advantage of the new information.

(set_flex_counter)

I get your objection. We have other places where we do "((TYPE *)NULL)->member"
explicitly to get at types, but I see what you mean that is feels very
wrong to see the "->" after setting something to NULL in that it's
separated from the NULL-ness.

One of the reasons for using __obj_ptr was because "VAR" may be a type
and not a variable, so "VAR.FAM" isn't possible. Doing it the following
way seemed uglier to me than using __obj_ptr->FAM:

	if (!WARN_ON_ONCE(!__can_set_flex_counter(((typeof(VAR) *)NULL)->FAM, __count)) &&

since we literally already have "((typeof(VAR) *)NULL)" with __obj_ptr.

But perhaps much of this could be collapsed into the
__can_set_flex_counter() helper instead.

What do you think?
