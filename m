I can see how mapping .text and .rodata as MAP_SHARED could
technically work, assuming the sharing process strictly mseals them to
guarantee they remain immutable. However, RELRO (.data.rel.ro) is a
different story. It must initially be mapped MAP_PRIVATE and writable
so that the dynamic linker can resolve relocations. Because these
modified pages cannot be written back to the backing file, they become
private anonymous pages.

If there was a way to allow an initially RW MAP_PRIVATE mapping to
resolve its relocations, be write-protected, mseal'd, and then have
its page tables shared, that would solve the RELRO issue. In the
Android Zygote model, this works perfectly because relocations resolve
before forking, meaning the resolutions are identical for all
children.

But how would we express this in the msharefs model? Transitioning a
post-CoW MAP_PRIVATE VMA into a shared page table structure seems
fundamentally at odds with a strictly MAP_SHARED file-backed
pseudo-filesystem approach.

I'd also like to think a bit about what happens to other standard
memory metrics. Should accounting that actively walks the page tables
(like /proc/pid/smaps) still work correctly and see the mappings?

What happens with the counter-based metrics tied directly to the
mm_struct rss stats?

Since msharefs manages its own detached mm_struct, should we include
those RSS counts across all sharing processes when reporting in
/proc/*/status? Or will we need to introduce a new UAPI to
independently expose and understand the RSS of each msharefs
mm_struct?
