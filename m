Whether my opinion is cared about or not, I feel it should be put in here:

Yes, *in theory* the bug is public. Anyone can find it. But just like bugs
sitting in open source code repositories, anyone can look for if it they tr=
y.

The only difference is that a LLM is making it more apparent and noticable
to people, if you ask it to.

The choice to then decide "therefore we can disclose it immediately", in my
opinion, is not great. Because then you are bringing attention to a bug tha=
t
nobody, or at most, relatively few people knew about (even in small circles=
)
to a broader audience.

Take Dirty Frag - even though the embargo is said to have been broken, and
all parties agreed to release the disclosure, it was put on GitHub. Of cour=
se,
information that is public, is public. But putting it on GitHub and then
buying the domain dirtyfrag.io makes it easy to bring attention to the bug
that was disclosed **with no patch or CVE.**

Even if the mitigation is "just disable the module", I still think that by
giving up the embargo entirely, we are creating more attention, and more
opportunity for exploitation. Even if it's a PoC and not an exploit for
malicious purposes.

Yes. I agree. But in theory that person did not need to use AI to find the
bug, so by that logic, the bug was already known about.

I think that's more "unresponsible disclosure" - maybe there is some way
that LLM emails can be filtered?

And again, yes, the data is being trained. But **you have to look for it.**=
.
It is still a needle in a haystack, but it's not a black hole absorbing
said haystack.

Could this at least be temporary? There are only a finite number of bugs
that can exist in a codebase.
