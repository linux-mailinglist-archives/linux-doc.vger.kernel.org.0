As I understand it, Mayank found this because the watchdog was
reacting significantly more slowly than he expected. In his caes, he
tracked it down to the fact that 8250 console driver has several calls
to touch_nmi_watchdog(), including on every call to console_write().
This caused the watchdog to take _much_ longer to fire.

On devices that fairly chatty w/ their output to the serial console,
the console_write() is called almost constantly. That means that the
watchdog is being touched constantly. If I remember Mayank tracked it
down as:

* watchdog_hardlockup_check() called and saves counter (1000)
* timer runs and updates the timer (1000 -> 1001)
* touch_nmi_watchdog() is called
* CPU locks up
* 10 seconds pass
* watchdog_hardlockup_check() called and saves counter (1001)
* 10 seconds pass
* watchdog_hardlockup_check() called and notices touch
* 10 seconds pass
* watchdog_hardlockup_check() called and finally detects lockup

...so we detect the lockup after 30 seconds, which is pretty bad. With
his new scheme, we'd detect the lockup in 20 seconds.

I guess the problem is that these sinners tend to touch the watchdog
because they _might_ end up blocking too long. ...and they touch the
watchdog constantly. Essentially:

while (something_might_be_slow()) {
  touch_nmi_watchdog();
  do_something();
}

Even if the operation is _usually_ not slow (like console write), if
the code has a chance of being slow then it will have the touch.

Great catch! When I was thinking about Mayank's patches, I thought
about them independently. ...and I believe that independently, each
patch is fine. The problem is that together they have exactly the
problem you indicated.

Clearing "hrtimer_interrupts_missed" seems like the right solution in
Mayank's patch #3.

I don't think it's really any more likely to report false positives
after the bug you pointed out is fixed. The old watchdog was just too
conservative. With Mayank's proposal I think calling
touch_nmi_watchdog() should reset the watchdog the same amount as
letting the hrtimer run once and that seems like a very reasonable
interpretation.

Hmmmm. I certainly support trying to reduce the number of places that
call touch_nmi_watchdog(), but at the same time I don't think Mayank's
patch is "dancing around" the problem. IMO considering the
touch_nmi_watchdog() to be "pretend a timer interrupt fired" is the
intuitive way one would think the call should work. The fact that the
code gave an entire extra 10 seconds before the watchdog could be
caught just feels like a bug that should be fixed.

For the 8250 driver in particular, it looks like the
touch_nmi_watchdog() was removed from serial8250_console_write() as
part of nbcon, but then that got reverted. That would still leave two
other touch_nmi_watchdog() calls in that driver...
