Basically this boils down to the question whether it is generally more
useful to have a Link: tag with a very specific meaning and potentially
*other* less specific additional tags for other purposes, or to not
define a specific meaning to the Link: tag at all.

I promote the former, with e.g. References: used for more free form
references. I'm really fine with either, but with the latter I'll just
filter out submitter added Link: tags and turn them to References: or
something in my corner of the kernel. (Meaning that lax Link: tags will
have a detrimental effect on workflows that do not match the one you
have in mind... ;)

BR,
Jani.
