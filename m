I strongly recommend separating this from your patchset. Avoid including
unrelated changes in a single patchset.

MGLRU has a mechanism to ensure that file and anon pages can keep pace
with each other. In the newest kernel, the minimum generation is 2. For
example, if anon has only 2 generations left and we decide to reclaim
anon folios, we will fall back to reclaiming file pages. Sometimes,
this means that anon reclamation is insufficient while file pages are
over-reclaimed.

static int scan_folios(unsigned long nr_to_scan, struct lruvec *lruvec,
                       struct scan_control *sc, int type, int tier,
                       struct list_head *list)
{
        ...
        if (get_nr_gens(lruvec, type) =3D=3D MIN_NR_GENS)
                return 0;
        ...
}

This is probably not a bug, but this design can sometimes work
suboptimally.

Regarding this issue, both Kairui (from the Linux server side, cc-ed) and I
(from the Android side) have observed it. This should be addressed in
MGLRU's code, and we already have kernel code for that. It is unrelated
to your patchset, so you shouldn=E2=80=99t include so many unrelated change=
s in
a single patchset.

Please keep your patchset focused solely on whether the MGLRU proactive
reclamation interface should be promoted to sysfs (LRU_GEN already has a
folder in sysfs) instead of debugfs, if there is a v2.

The following is quoted from
`Documentation/admin-guide/mm/multigen_lru.rst`.

Proactive reclaim
-----------------
Proactive reclaim induces page reclaim when there is no memory
pressure. It usually targets cold pages only. E.g., when a new job
comes in, the job scheduler wants to proactively reclaim cold pages on
the server it selected, to improve the chance of successfully landing
this new job.

Users can write the following command to ``lru_gen`` to evict
generations less than or equal to ``min_gen_nr``.

    ``- memcg_id node_id min_gen_nr [swappiness [nr_to_reclaim]]``

Nope. This is just an internal detail of MGLRU and shouldn=E2=80=99t be exp=
osed
as an interface.
Hopefully, Kairui or I will send a patchset soon to address the balance
issue between file and anon pages. For now, you can use `swappiness=3D201`
as a temporary workaround. Take a look at bytedance's patchset.[1]
