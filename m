In the past I run sphinx builds on a small 4GB VM (2cpu) without any problems.
(nowadays) 16 CPU, 16 GB PC with sphinx-build the max load of my whole PC is
about 5GB (*more CPUs need more mem*).

@Randy you said the build machine hase 8GB .. and how much CPUs?

d'accord

Sphinx-doc is pure Python, it runs a lot of regexpr and is moving string,
nothing special .. maybe we have a mem leak in one of our extensions?

@Kess: why did you mentioning MAINTAINERS parsing .. did you observe anything
strange?

Maybe one of the tools used by sphinx is buggy (latex, dot, image-magic) .. 
needs investigation.

@Randy: my first questions are:

- cpu / mem?
- are OOM-kills when building target htmldocs, pdfdocs or ..?
- which py & sphinx version are used? Reference installation see 'virtualenv'
