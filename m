And is that in the files you added?  They are binary so it's hard to
determine this :(

Yes, it can not be a dual one.

Which it shouldn't be :(

Anyway, this is independent of the issue if we actually should take
these fonts into the kernel tree, and mandate their use (my opinion is
no, that's not for us to use, and especially for any action that might
cause a web browser to look elsewhere outside of our documentation.)

Also, for documentation, I'm pretty sure that serif fonts is proven to
be "nicer" overall by many studies.
