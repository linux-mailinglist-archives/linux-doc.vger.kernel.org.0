It is applied (now).  However, it took some work on my side.

This patch puts the file into .../zh_CN/mm/, but that directory doesn't
exist in docs-next - that is a change that is sitting in the -mm tree
and won't make it into docs-next until after the merge window.
Interestingly, "git am" somehow found vm/index.html and applied the
relevant change there, but transhuge.rst ended up in the wrong place.

It wouldn't be hard to move it over, but that would introduce another
conflict against -mm.  So the right thing to do, I think, is to hold it
until after the merge window.

In the future, *please* make your changes against docs-next if you're
going to send them to me.

Thanks,

jon
