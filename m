Okay, I'd suspected as much after poking around things a bit. Another 
possibility would be to have a separate repository where we commit the 
doc tree (after it's massaged into the "ready to be built with sphinx" 
condition). We could run this automatically on our end on each mainline 
release, but it's certainly not a necessity.

Glad to hear it. My primary interest in getting it hooked up with RTD 
was just from the perspective of creating an external mirror for folks 
who are already using RTD. For now, I'm going to shelve this effort and 
just continue building docs straight from the tree on our end.

Thanks for your help!
