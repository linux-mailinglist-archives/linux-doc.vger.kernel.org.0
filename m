Hi, 

it's been quite a long time, but I really want to try again,
because the last 5 times I tried to send in a patch,
the information I wrote down here is EXACTLY what I needed (5 times...)

I cleaned up the patch a little bit (only very minor modifications),
but before I send this again, let me try to comment on the original
critique.

Additionally I am not even sure how to post a modified patch
to this mailing list :-).
(I need to look that up again).

Summary: I really really think the information I wrote down
is highly useful for someone who:
* knows about git
* knows about e-mail
* in general knows about computers

and just wonders 

    How do I submit a patch for the Linux Kernel source code ?

The text I wrote IS NOT meant for:
* People who do not know about git
* People who do not know about the general workings of E-Mail
* People who in general are working 1st time on a programming project.


With that preface,  referring to the last E-Mail (long time ago...)

What my patch tries to provide is explicitly what it says in the commit message

   A primer how to submit a single git commit...

This is not meant to be "introductory".
I expect people who read this to have a working knowledge of:

* Compiling the Linux kernel
* Using git
* Good background knowledge about IT technology in general (like E-Mail ...)

I was in exactly this position; so I googled for 

    linux kernel submit patch

and "submitting-patches" is the one document which stands out.
Note: My code modification was already finished; it compiled, it worked,
I just didn't know how to publish that modification.

I did not google for "an introduction to the Linux Kernel", 
"an introduction how to write a Linux driver", etc.
I did not need an "introduction" to anything. I had the concrete question 

  How exactly do I submit a patch for the Linux Kernel source code?

I think the current "submitting-patches.rst" answers this pretty vaguely.

> That's meant to be a comprehensive set

If you want to get this document shorter, my suggestion would be:
Move all the "comprehensive" part to somewhere else.

I think the document tells you as a side note how to submit a patch;
especially if it's just a minor bug-fix.

So why is this document labeled "submitting-patches" ?

As far as I can tell at least half of the document talks 
about how to write your code modifications so that they are acceptable.
But that's more about "coding style" or 
"general guidelines for writing Linux Kernel source code" 
and not about the process how to submit a patch.

The document currently tells you:
  * 1) Use "diff -up"
    I think this is completely outdated. 
    No one using git will use "diff -up".
    I guess 99% of the people working on the Linux Kernel use git

  * 2) Describe your changes
    That's interesting for someone who has some major work done.
    It's completely irrelevant for someone who wants to send in a minor fix.

  * 3) Separate your Changes
    Again completely irrelevant for someone who wants to send in a minor fix.

  * 5) Select the recipients for your patch
    Unfortunately this section does not tell you about 
       ./scripts/get_maintainer.pl
    which is what you really need.
etc,...

All of this information is useful if someone wants to send in some major modification, 
split over several files and many commits; 
but that's not really about "submitting a patch"; it is more about how to work 
together with other kernel developers to get your contribution into a state,
where it will be accepted.

Additionally it seems the document focuses on how to send a patch via 
a regular E-Mail client (outlook/thunderbird ...); there also is a 
separate document for this (process/email-clients.rst).

My personal experience: Do not use any of these E-Mail clients 
at all; they make life 100% more complicated...
and that's exactly what "process/email-clients.rst" tells you too.

This sentence means: 
Don't try this on a 20 year old machine which runs a Linux 2.6 kernel.
That's anyway a bad idea, because compiling and testing your patch
will take ages.
What "too old" means is subjective in this sentence.
As long as you (as a developer) are satisfied, then the machine
is obviously not "too old".

I disagree: This is unbelievable helpful.

Let me try to explain:
My biggest problem was to find out that "git send-email" exists.
So far "git send-email" is only mentioned as a side note 
in "submitting-patches.rst" under the section 
  15) Explicit In-Reply-To headers

I already was using git quite a lot, but there never was any need 
to use "git send-email", because nowadays lots of projects use "github"
or if it's inside a company "gitea" or whatever.
This means most of the time, patches are NOT send via E-Mail.

Not that I find anything wrong with E-Mail; 
it's just not used for that many projects.


So then I found out that "git send-email" exists.
So the first thing I tried was to execute
   git send-email ...
and my git tells me it doesn't know this command. 
Huh ?
Oh it turns out "git send-email" is NOT installed per default,
when you install "git". 
"git send-email" is installed as a separate package...
I think "gentoo" might have it directly in the "git" package,
but even there I am not sure.

Next question: Do I have to setup my Mail Transport Agent in a specific
way to use "git send-email" ? 

I know enough about E-Mail etc, to know what an MTA is in principle.

It turns out I do not need to do anything here because "git send-email"
already does it all (because it directly talks to an SMTP server).

Good to know.

I and probably tons of other computer affine people understand
what this means, because we know how E-Mail works in principle.

I disagree: 
The target for this primer are people who do understand computers
and Internet and E-Mail and so on.

The target are people, who just don't know how to send in a patch for
the Linux Kernel source code.

If I know what I have to put in the configuration of an E-Mail client
(instead of clicking "auto-detect" or "Wizard"), I very well know what
"smtpserver", "smtpserverport" etc means, because that's exactly
what I need to put into the configuration of my E-Mail client too.

Also: I expect someone reading this to use google and search for

    git send-email configuration

I expect someone reading this to use google and search for

   git config email

Well thinking more about this sentence :-)
I actually expect someone reading this to already
have executed these commands. 
So you might completely leave this out.

I tried to fix this (not published yet).

Does "checkpatch" work for ".rst" files ?
I was not aware...

Because you mentioned line lengths:
I would find it quite useful to enforce line breaks at the
output of the ".rst" files, so what you get displayed here:

  https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v4.17/process/submitting-patches.html

It really helps to have short paragraphs which do not span over the
whole width of my huge 16:9 display.
Is that possible and allowed for the ".rst" files, or this a "no no" ?

I don't agree:
I basically expect that people who want to send in a patch for the 
Linux Kernel source code to be able to use git anyway.

What's specific for the Linux Kernel is what's expected for the commit message.
Looking at other projects on github: There are a lot of them who use different
suggestions how your commit message should look like; many many many projects
are simply too small to start of with "<subsystem>:".

I strongly disagree.

We are talking about your *local* git repository here.
Of course you should start to create commits in 
your *local* git repository.
That's the whole point of using git.

The test phase is about to get your local commits into such 
a shape that you are confident to publish them via E-Mail.

Even with testing it's not 100% guaranteed, that what you publish 
is completely correct. That's why I wrote "hopefully":
It's entirely possible that you publish your change and someone
else (or even yourself) tells you:
    What happens if ...
and then it turns out you overlooked something and you created 
a problem instead of fixing one.

Maybe I should rephrase that to say
   Test your changes; they must compile. Do your best to ensure
   that your changes are fixing a problem and not creating a new one.

?

Because this is in your *local* repository.
With git,  "commit" does not mean "publish".
You should not *publish* untested changes;
but it totally makes sense to "commit" them locally, ...
and repeat this several times until you are satisfied.

I do it differently:
I expect to run "git commit" several times
(see above, we are talking about your local git repository).

I don't want to run
  git commit -s
every time (I might forget it at least once).

So I do that once, when I am ready to publish the patch.
Of course other people might have different preferences;
I just don't see why I should always enforce a 
sign-off line in my *local* (not published) commits.

I disagree.
It's right before you are ready to publish your code modification.
What you did in the meantime is completely irrelevant (except for yourself),
because none of that is published.

Yes exactly: That's why my commit message says "... using git send-email".

That's why I so strongly focus on "git send-email"; 
using other E-Mail clients is a nightmare IMHO.

so long
