Sorry for not having looked at this earlier. I think overall it's looking
good, mostly just a bunch of comments on lifetime/locking questions.

I'm also wondering a bit how much we want to go overboard with igt tests,
since the lifetime fun is quite big here. I think at least some basic
tests that trying to do nasty things like unbind the driver in sysfs and
then try to use configfs, or keeping the vkms_device alive with an open fd
and removing the configfs directory would be really good.

One thing that's a bit tricky is that configfs is considered uapi, so must
be stable forever. And I think that's actually the right thing for us,
since we want compositors and other projects to use this for their
testing. So unlike igt tests using special debugfs interfaces, which are
ok to be very tightly coupled to kernel releases

Cheers, Sima
