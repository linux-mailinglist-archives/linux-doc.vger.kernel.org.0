No, it's always been like that. The formatting of the prefixes have
always been totally different in this function, probably because filling
a memory buffer and sending these messages to dmesg is fundamentally
different and we may want a different behaviour *when sending to the
kernel buffer*. That is what I believe is useful. If someone wishes to
port the feature to the other functions, they can, but it is irrelevant
to the change brought here.

seq_hex_dump() has diverged already and is a very specific case that is
probably under stability constraints, where trimming down the output
lines is likely much less useful.

I am not strongly opposed to it, but it is probably a bit useless.

No... that is not how these function work nor have been designed for,
hex_dump_to_buffer is used as a line-oriented helper to fill a kernel
buffer line which *is* a line-oriented buffer. A prefix gets added to
it, and I want to skip the printing if it's redundant. Lines are sent
one after the other using printk anyway. All this logic has nothing to
do inside hex_dump_to_buffer at all. Plus, what you ask for would
require a new buffer to be allocated, potentially big and unbounded,
which would require a GFP flag (yay! a new parameter). And finally the
implementation itself would be much less obvious if the algorithm was
not line oriented.

I am sorry, but I really took the time to understand your request but it
is simply not working well technically nor conceptually desirable IMO.

Please Andy, stop asking loads and loads of unachievable changes to fit
your ideal. I am bringing something that I feel can be useful, just stop
with your endless list of unrelated (and in this case unreachable)
wishes. There is nothing testing the prefixes, if there was a suitable
test case I would improve it, but there is none, because the test suite
is not used like that.

Who's we? Where is this documented?
There is no test case checking the kernel buffer printing.
I'm not skilled enough to write one.

And this is typically what I dislike in some of your reviews. There is
always a context, trying to ignore it is pointless.

I know this is generally requested, but once again, dumping pages of
data where this flag might be useful makes sense during debug sessions
in very particular places, keeping these debug calls does not seem very
useful to me, but that's certainly easier to achieve than your previous
request.
