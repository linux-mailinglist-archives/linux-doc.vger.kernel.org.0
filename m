He won't pull from GitHub in the absence of a maintainer signature that he
recognizes.

Anyway, fixing these URLs seems like worthwhile work, but there is no way
that I can pull this patch series.  Let's just say that the response to 
pushing it into linux-next would make me very glad that social distancing
is in effect.

If you want to get this work merged, you're going to have to take a
different approach.  I see a couple of options:

 - Split the patches apart by subsystem, do what you can to reduce their
   number (combine all changes to a set of related files into one patch,
   for example), and submit the relevant patches to each subsystem
   maintainer.  I will take patches for files under Documentation/ with
   this kind of change, for example.  I can guarantee that some
   maintainers will be more welcoming of this work than others, but many
   will probably accept it.

 - Take your series directly to Linus and see if he is willing to merge it
   as an "end of the merge window" item.  My feeling is that your chances
   for success would be quite low, but I've been wrong before.

Thanks,

jon
