Could you describe an existing infrastructure I can use here? Let's look at
this recent "Copy Fail" thing as an example.

I can obviously build my own kernel and enroll my own key, but 99.9% of our
users won't be doing that.

Livepatching, or manually building a module that just injects a kprobe is out
of the question as we previously agreed.

systemtap falls into the same bucket as building my own module.

BPF doesn't help because bpf_override_return() requires the target to be on the
same within_error_injection_list() whitelist as fault injection, and the CVE
targets never are. Some of our fleet doesn't even have BPF enabled either, but
that's the smaller objection.

I can't use fault injection because:

  a. It's almost never built in production/distro kernels, and I suspect this
won't change.
  b. The functions I need are not whitelisted.
  c. Even if (a) and (b) were addressed, fault injection would still need a
securityfs front-end, a cmdline parser, a module-unload notifier, a taint flag,
and audit on engage and disengage. By the time those land in fail_function and
tie into/refactor the fault injection code, the net diff is bigger than this
proposal.

In my case I can remove the module, but not if I run a distro that shipped with
CONFIG_CRYPTO_USER_API_AEAD=y (like RHEL/SUSE).

I can use "initcall_blacklist=" hack and reboot, but as things stand today,
I'll need to be rebooting few times a day.

Even if I'm okay with rebooting that often (and I really really would prefer
not to), this doesn't solve the issues of a larger fleet of servers that can't
just reboot that often.

What am I missing?
