That's part of the problem here. It's unclear what problem or problems
you're trying to solve. You started off with the miscdev issue, this
thing morphed into something else, and now everything is just a big
mess with unclear semantics and a totally confused implementation.

Look, I'm not blaming you for how we ended up here. This thing should
not have been merged until there was a general agreement on the
usefulness of the API (which requires a problem statement and use case).

The right people clearly didn't look at this in any detail since they
did not expect it to be merged any time soon.

And it's just unfair to you to have to redesign the whole thing under
time pressure a few days before the merge window opens. New code is
supposed to be ready weeks in advance, not be created and merged only
days before.

Right. It's not needed. You have a refcounted structure and you can use
the refcount to prevent it from going away.

Yes, it can. You just need to make sure you hold a reference. And
redesign the API to let you do so.

Yeah, you'd need to store the SRCU index elsewhere (e.g. int, typedef,
context struct).

Yes, it can. You just need to take a step back and redesign this thing
again.

And that should be done out-of-tree.
