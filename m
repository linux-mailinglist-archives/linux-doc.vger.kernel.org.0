Thank you for this detailed explanation. I would like to concentrate on
the #1 first. What happens in the driver is you are essentially rolling
asynchronous probing and asynchronous suspend/resume in the driver
itself, and end up fighting with the kernel and the driver core
specifically.

As far as suspend/resume goes: HID subsystem already enables
asynchronous resume handling (checkout the call to
device_enable_async_suspend() in
drivers/hid/hid-core.c::hid_allocate_device()). Therefore I think you
just need to stick the necessary delay in your resume method() and call
it a day.

For the probing I would look into annotating the driver as 
PROBE_PREFER_ASYNCHRONOUS and relying on that. Again, if you stick the
required delay in probe then sysfs attributes will not be created too
early, same for the rest of concerns with the device being exposed to
userspace before it is ready to handle requests.

If there are issues with HID subsystem honoring
PROBE_PREFER_ASYNCHRONOUS I would look into fixing the subsystem rather
than try to work around it in the driver.

Thanks.
