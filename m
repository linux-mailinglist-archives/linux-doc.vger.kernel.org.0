For many files, the missing commits might not be needed as they might 
not affect the translation (such as typos in English).

Because this new commit style is developed recently by Yanteng and me, 
many translated documenation does not tranform to the corresponding styles.

Yes, we need more volunteers to translate English documents. However, 
translation is not attractive in the LLM era. :(

Yes, if zh_TW can apply this convention the workflow would be more 
reasonable.

For the todo list, you can check Jon's advice for new languages, e.g., 
Spanish. Search it from LKML
