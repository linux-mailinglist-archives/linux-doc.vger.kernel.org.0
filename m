Same as non alternating version so mA (which is a historical design error we have
long been stuck with :()  The altvoltageY_raw docs don't give a unit either.
If you don't mind, please send a patch adding that whilst you are here.
Same mid to peak - hopefully that is what any users not modifying to RMS have
been doing!

Seems we either never had one or that particular bit of ABI doc is missing.
Please add an entry for altcurrentX_raw

Becomes a question of whether it is useful to represent that - maybe not
in this particular case.

For altcurrent / altvoltage assumption is it's mid to peak.  Unless the modifier switches
it to RMS as you've noted.

This is a good question.  We ran into ambiguity with events where we have to derive
if it is _raw or _processed for the thresholds based on whether the main attribute
is _raw or _processed.  Nice to avoid doing that again.

I'd be interesting in others views on this but to me raw_roc seems fine.

Agreed - but to get to directly useable values we'd need to provide info on the
external circuit - and given we are dealing with AC signals that is tricky to do
in a compact way.

Agreed.  It is always (?) possible to switch between scale and raw.
For an ADC the distinction is clear as we can't control _raw. For a DAC it all gets
rather value as we can logically control both and for an AC type of DAC / DDS it
all gets less intuitive.  As you say, consistency is key.

I'd like us to at least be consistent across DDS devices. Perhaps we need some
general documentation on whatever the outcome of this discussion is to record
some of the logic behind those decisions.
