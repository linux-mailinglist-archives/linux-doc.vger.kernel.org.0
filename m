I have a couple of thoughts, neither of which is sufficient for me to
oppose the change if there is consensus for it:

- You're saying that people need to grep email addresses out of the git
  history before crediting them in a tag; that's not a step we have
  required of people before and seems like a bit much..?

- It would be awfully nice if we could provide this advice in exactly
  one place in the document.  This is one of our most important docs,
  and it is far too long to expect new contributors to read through and
  absorb.  Avoiding making it longer and more repetitive would be
  better, if we can.

- I wonder if it would make sense to say that, if an implicit-permission
  tag has been added, the person named in it should get at least one
  copy of the change before it is merged?

OK, three thoughts, you know what they say about off-by-one errors :)

Thanks,

jon
