But it is still about comparing the cost of running on different CPUs
at different performance levels.

For instance, say the scale-invariant utilization of a task is 256 and
it can run either by itself on a P-core, or with another task whose
utilization is 128 on an E-core, and say the P-core's and E-core's
capacity is 1024 and 512, respectively.

Say the cost function tells EAS that running a P-core at 1/4 of the
capacity is cheaper than running an E-core at 3/4 capacity, so it will
pick up the P-core to run that task, but if cpufreq ramps up the
frequency of the P-core to the max when the task gets to it, it may
actually turn out to be more expensive.

This means that EAS still has an expectation regarding cpufreq which
is that it will generally tend to run tasks at the performance level
corresponding to the sum of their scale-invariant utilization at least
roughly.

IIUC this actually has nothing to do with whether or not the energy
model used by EAS is artificial.  The schedutil requirement is about
choosing a performance level proportional to the utilization (which
schedutil generally tends to do by design).

If this is about allowing EAS to work with intel_pstate running in the
active mode, you may argue that what the processor firmware is doing
when intel_pstate runs in the active mode is not much different from
what schedutil would do.  So a driver implementing an internal
governor (that is, using the .set_policy() callback) would need to
declare that its internal governor is as good as schedutil from EAS'
perspective and so it will pass the "cpufreq readiness" check.

I would do

if (!pd)
        continue;

here because the CPUs without a PD simply don't matter.

Also, is any synchronization needed for this?

And should it go into the EM code?
