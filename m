Yeah I don't see any reason why we need to know precisely which model or version
of said model we need.

Yup.

Honestly I find the phrasing here quite vague.

While it is interesting to track the degree of AI involvement (where that's
disclosed) a really important part of this is how maintainers deal with AI
submissions.

Also we have a schism in the documentation anyway, there's [0] which is
literally indexed as 'AI Coding Assistants', which says NOTHING about how
people are supposed to use them etc. and there's [1] Which DOES say
something about that, but which isn't linked to by [0], nor links to it.

Before I happened across this thread, I was thinking of sending a patch to
at least link one to the other. Now I think I definitely will.

As I mentioned off-list I do agree that this is key.

Having this information helps with the most important issue we face when it
comes to AI - an EXISTENTIAL issue actually IMO - the asymmetry between how
much code can be generated, and available maintainer/reviewer resource.

Being able to, at a glance, see that a series was both wholly generated
seems substandard means we can quickly ask for more human attention.

And I know what the argument's going to be - 'bad faith people will lie
about it' - and sure, yes they will.

But now that there's been a huge surge of AI generated code in mm I can
speak from experience - many DO attribute, and for those that don't it's
very useful to have guidelines to point to.

Both aid in dealing with this asymmetry.

(as an example, I've had to push back quite strongly on an _attributed_
series ([2] and [3]) that appeared to be wholly generated. Having this
information would have helped there).

Yeah this format works I think!

Well you're probably thinking of [1], e.g.:

	Second, when making a contribution, be transparent about the origin
	of content in cover letters and changelogs. You can be more
	transparent by adding information like this:

	...

	- Which portions of the content were affected by that tool?

	...


And also from the same document:

	If tools permit you to generate a contribution automatically,
	expect additional scrutiny in proportion to how much of it was
	generated.

	As with the output of any tooling, the result may be incorrect or
	inappropriate. You are expected to understand and to be able to
	defend everything you submit. If you are unable to do so, then do
	not submit the resulting changes.

	If you do so anyway, maintainers are entitled to reject your series
	without detailed review.

This only speaks more to the need to link the two documents together. I'll
send a patch.
