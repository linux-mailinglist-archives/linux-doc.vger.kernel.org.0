 Frequently Asked Questions
+--------------------------
 
-o	Why would anyone want to use RCU?
+- Why would anyone want to use RCU?
 
-	The advantage of RCU's two-part approach is that RCU readers need
-	not acquire any locks, perform any atomic instructions, write to
-	shared memory, or (on CPUs other than Alpha) execute any memory
-	barriers.  The fact that these operations are quite expensive
-	on modern CPUs is what gives RCU its performance advantages
-	in read-mostly situations.  The fact that RCU readers need not
-	acquire locks can also greatly simplify deadlock-avoidance code.

-	if the RCU readers give no indication when they are done?
+- How can the updater tell when a grace period has completed
+  if the RCU readers give no indication when they are done?
 
-	Just as with spinlocks, RCU readers are not permitted to
-	block, switch to user-mode execution, or enter the idle loop.
-	Therefore, as soon as a CPU is seen passing through any of these
-	three states, we know that that CPU has exited any previous RCU
-	read-side critical sections.  So, if we remove an item from a
-	linked list, and then wait until all CPUs have switched context,
-	executed in user mode, or executed in the idle loop, we can
-	safely free up that item.

-	Preemptible variants of RCU (CONFIG_PREEMPT_RCU) get the
-	same effect, but require that the readers manipulate CPU-local
-	counters.  These counters allow limited types of blocking within
-	RCU read-side critical sections.  SRCU also uses CPU-local
-	counters, and permits general blocking within RCU read-side
-	critical sections.  These variants of RCU detect grace periods
-	by sampling these counters.
