I mean on Tumbleweed only.
Leap's xecjk is v3.4.8 and has no dependency on ctex.

I'm afraid I don't think so.
At Debian Latex wiki [3], they say:

  If you want to add support for your language (other than english) in
  TeX Live, search for texlive-lang [4] and install your language.

[3]: https://wiki.debian.org/Latex
[4]: https://packages.debian.org/search?keywords=texlive-lang

This is the Debian's policy of TeX Live packaging.
I wouldn't complain if they say "Just install both of texlive-xetex
and texlive-lang-chinese if you want xecjk to work."

There are a lot of inter-collection dependencies in upstream TeX
Live, but many of then are ignored in TeX Live/Debian packages.
For example, ctex has a dependency on xecjk (reverse of the newly
added one) in upstream, but Debian's texlive-lang-chinese does not
depend on texlive-xetex.
