Sorry, but what you're saying is just not true.

The Broadcast RGB property is an Intel specific property. It lacked
documentation but the user space contract exists and it based on how
i915 implemented it. By changing the semantics you're breaking user
space. The documentation has to document the current contract between
i915 and user space, not whatever you want the property to be like.

I get that you're frustrated that you have to do work while i915 doesn't
but none of that is relevant for what the property is and how user space
expects it to work.

I'm reviewing the parts that I can, and that's the uAPI. I find it
really offensive that you're saying that this is pointless and mundate.
The uAPI is your end product, if it can't be used, everything you do in
your driver is utterly pointless.

Displays can accept both RGB and YCbCr signals, drivers can chose
whichever they want, and user space can not influence or even know which
one is being used.

The automatic selection of the range is very different between RGB and
YCbCr. If user space forces the range to a specific value and the driver
for whatever reason switches from RGB to YCbCr or the other way around,
this forcing of the range will most likely be incorrect.

This is what we're talking about when we say that the semantics of the
vc4 Broadcast RGB property is broken. User space literally cannot use it
consistenly. By restricting it to RGB signals, user space can user it
consistently and fix monitors that do not follow the automatic
quantization range algorithm correctly. Yes, if there is an issue with
the quantization range of a YCbCr signal then this property doesn't
help, but it never tried to help those cases.

I mean, vc4 doesn't work fine apparently. You're just lucky that no one
reported issues to you.

All you have to do is adjust the documentation to say that Broadcast RGB
only affects RGB signalling. Yes, vc4 has a bug according to the docs
then, but that's okay. Fix it at some point.
