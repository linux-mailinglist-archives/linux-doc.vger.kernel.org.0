So I totally approve of fixing docs build warnings, so thanks for doing
this work.  As I was working through the patches, though, I noticed that
these patches are against linux-next, so I can't take them into the docs
tree.  Instead, each fix needs to go into the tree that has introduced
the problem.

Thus, I encourage you to separate out this patch set, add an appropriate
Fixes tag to each, then send each separately to the same places where
the original patch went.  That should get these problems fixed before
they go into mainline.

Sorry to make more work, but I'd like to see these changes get in.  I've
commented on a couple of the individual patches as well.

Thanks,

jon
