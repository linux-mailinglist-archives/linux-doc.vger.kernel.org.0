With sphinx-build version 6.2.1 and latest linux-next, I'm getting:

<snip>
<p>Defined on file <a class="reference internal" href="#abi-file-testing-sysfs-bus-papr-pmem"><span class="std std-ref">sysfs-bus-papr-pmem</span></a></p>
<p>(RO) Report flags indicating various states of a

flags returned in response to this hcall is available

It seems that references are properly evaluated there.

Actually, this is not related to automarkup.py, but, instead to
get_abi automation. You can see how this is processed by running
get_abi.pl script, e. g.:

<snip>
$ ./scripts/get_abi.pl search nmemX/papr/flags

/sys/bus/nd/devices/nmemX/papr/flags

Kernel version:		v5.8
Date:			Apr, 2020

Defined on file(s):	Documentation/ABI/testing/sysfs-bus-papr-pmem

Description:

(RO) Report flags indicating various states of a
papr-pmem NVDIMM device. Each flag maps to a one or
more bits set in the dimm-health-bitmap retrieved in
response to H_SCM_HEALTH hcall. The details of the bit
flags returned in response to this hcall is available
at 'Documentation/arch/powerpc/papr_hcalls.rst' . Below are
the flags reported in this sysfs file:

* "not_armed"
                  Indicates that NVDIMM contents will not
                  survive a power cycle.
* "flush_fail"
                  Indicates that NVDIMM contents
                  couldn't be flushed during last
                  shut-down event.
* "restore_fail"
                  Indicates that NVDIMM contents
                  couldn't be restored during NVDIMM
                  initialization.
* "encrypted"
                  NVDIMM contents are encrypted.
* "smart_notify"
                  There is health event for the NVDIMM.
* "scrubbed"
                  Indicating that contents of the
                  NVDIMM have been scrubbed.
* "locked"
                  Indicating that NVDIMM contents can't
                  be modified until next power cycle.
</snip>

The output there is not in ReST format. There is a "rest" parameter
to generate the version actually used by Sphinx.

When "./scripts/get_abi.pl rest" is used, it converts any reference
of Documentation/xxx.rst into[1]:

	:doc:`/xxx`

Which is actually a relative link, pointing to the file at:

	<doc_source_dir>/xxx.rst

The references there are relative to the doc root directory passed
to sphinx-build (Documentation/). So, the above shall create a
cross-reference to Documentation/xxx.rst using the document title as the
name of the reference, so this will become:

	<a class="reference internal" href="../arch/powerpc/papr_hcalls.html"><span class="doc">Hypercall Op-codes (hcalls)</span></a>

[1] see https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/guides/cross-referencing-with-sphinx.html#the-doc-role

See how a similar link is converted to ReST format:

<snip>
$ ./scripts/get_abi.pl rest |grep -A20 /mte_tcf_preferred
Warning: file Documentation/ABI/testing/sysfs-platform-silicom#20:

Preferred MTE tag checking mode

When a user program specifies more than one MTE tag checking
mode, this sysfs node is used to specify which mode should
be preferred when scheduling a task on that CPU. Possible
values:

================  ==============================================
"sync"            Prefer synchronous mode
"asymm"           Prefer asymmetric mode
"async"           Prefer asynchronous mode
================  ==============================================

With a quote like "`", the above would be evaluated to:
	
See also: `:doc:`/arch/arm64/memory-tagging-extension``

which will probably cause problems when sphinx parses it.

That's said, I remember that some old Sphinx versions had issues 
with the doc: tag. On some legacy versions, the <doc_source_dir>
is set in a wrong way, ignoring the path used at the sphinx-build
directory parameter.

Thanks,
