There is "motivational dependency" because one of the main reasons I'm
converting the vm_lock into vm_refcnt is to make it easier to add
SLAB_TYPESAFE_BY_RCU (see my last reply to Hillf). But technically we
can leave the SLAB_TYPESAFE_BY_RCU out of this series if that makes
thighs easier. That would be the 2 patches at the end:

mm: prepare lock_vma_under_rcu() for vma reuse possibility
mm: make vma cache SLAB_TYPESAFE_BY_RCU

I made sure that each patch is bisectable, so there should not be a
problem with tracking issues.

Hmm. I was diligently updating the tests to reflect the replacement of
vm_lock with vm_refcnt and adding assertions for detach/attach cases.
This actually reminds me that I missed updading vm_area_struct in
vma_internal.h for the member regrouping patch; will add that. I think
the only part that did not affect tests is SLAB_TYPESAFE_BY_RCU but I
was not sure what kind of testing I can add for that. Any suggestions
would be welcomed.

Again, I'm open to suggestions for SLAB_TYPESAFE_BY_RCU testing but
for the rest I thought the tests were modified accordingly.

Ok, you mean to check that VMA re-attachment/re-detachment would
trigger assertions? I'll look into adding tests for that.

Again, I'm open to suggestions on what kind of testing I can add for
SLAB_TYPESAFE_BY_RCU change.

If you are referring to the issue at [1], I think David ran the
syzcaller against mm-stable that does not contain this patchset and
the issue still triggered (see [2]). This of course does not guarantee
that this patchset has no other issues :) I'll try adding tests for
re-attaching, re-detaching and welcome ideas on how to test
SLAB_TYPESAFE_BY_RCU transition.
Thanks,
Suren.
