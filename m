Actually, I think with a small change we can simplify these locking rules:

static inline void vma_start_write(struct vm_area_struct *vma)
{
        int mm_lock_seq;

-        if (__is_vma_write_locked(vma, &mm_lock_seq))
-                return;
+        mmap_assert_write_locked(vma->vm_mm);
+        mm_lock_seq =3D vma->vm_mm->mm_lock_seq;

        down_write(&vma->vm_lock->lock);
        /*
        * We should use WRITE_ONCE() here because we can have concurrent re=
ads
        * from the early lockless pessimistic check in vma_start_read().
        * We don't really care about the correctness of that early check, b=
ut
        * we should use WRITE_ONCE() for cleanliness and to keep KCSAN happ=
y.
        */
        WRITE_ONCE(vma->vm_lock_seq, mm_lock_seq);
        up_write(&vma->vm_lock->lock);
}

This will force vma_start_write() to always write-lock vma->vm_lock
before changing vma->vm_lock_seq. Since vma->vm_lock survives reuse,
the other readers/writers will synchronize on it even if vma got
reused.
