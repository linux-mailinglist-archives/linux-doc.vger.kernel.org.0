This looks concerning: It seems as if just filling the advertised
window triggered the out of memory condition(?).  Am I right in
assuming that this happened with the original 1d2fbaad7cd8, not the
relaxed version of tcp_can_ingest() from f017c1f768b?

Thanks, I missed that.

I agree, but there is a part that, I think, is more generally
applicable:

2.4.  Addressing Window Retraction

   [ specific window retraction case introduction removed ]
   ... Implementations MUST ensure that they handle a shrinking
   window, as specified in Section 4.2.2.16 of [RFC1122].

   For the receiver, this implies that:

   1)  The receiver MUST honor, as in window, any segment that would
       have been in window for any <ACK> sent by the receiver.

   2)  When window scaling is in effect, the receiver SHOULD track the
       actual maximum window sequence number (which is likely to be
       greater than the window announced by the most recent <ACK>, if
       more than one segment has arrived since the application consumed
       any data in the receive buffer).

There is no "When window scaling is in effect," on the first
requirement. And it "happens" to be implementable by the second
requirement (with or without window scaling).

I think an improvement could be to refer to the receiver requirements
specifically here.

Thanks for the pointer, I missed that tp->rcv_wnd update.  Could the
following happen when checkpointing/restoring?

1. A client app opens a connection and writes (blocking) a specific amount
   of data before doing any reads.  (Not very clever, but this is
   supposed to work; this is what caused the problem in the Valkey
   tests.)
2. The traffic pattern causes an out-of-memory condition for the
   receive buffer; we see the RWIN 0 segments that do not ack the
   last data segment(s).
3. TCP connection is checkpointed and restored (on the client side) without
   restoring rcv_mwnd_seq.
4. If the receive buffer is still full at the new location, the
   acceptable sequence numbers in the receive window will not change
   (restored client is still blocked on write) and we no longer have
   the larger max receive window -> the client's kernel will reject
   all incoming packets and the connection is stuck.

If this scenario is possible, I'd argue that rcv_mwnd_seq is
necessary.

Do we need a dedicated value indicating that rcv_mwnd_seq is not
present, or is it enough to choose an initial rcv_mwnd_seq based on
the size of the struct passed?  Both seem doable to me:

Missing: Initialize rcv_mwnd_seq = rcv_wup + rcv_wnd (possibly
leading to the problem described above, of course)

Default value 0: Store how much we retracted the window, i.e. 
rcv_mwnd_seq - (rcv_wup + rcv_wnd). 0 means the window was not
retracted and could double as the "we don't know" value.

For the time being, I will just initialize rcv_mwnd_seq to rcv_wup +
rcv_wnd in tcp_repair_set_window() to keep status quo. Of course,
I am happy to discuss enhancements.

tcp_max_receive_window() is an adapted copy of
tcp_receive_window() above. But it makes sense to improve it.

The substraction is unsigned and the outcome is interpreted as
signed. And as mentioned, it is copied with pride ;-)

Yes, same reason as above and I will change it.
