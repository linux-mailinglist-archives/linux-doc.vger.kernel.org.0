To be honest I found the existence of the CREDITS file useful when
removing stale MAINTAINERS entries. A move seems less hostile than 
a erasure (using a very broad definition of "move" in case of drivers).
Anything that makes people feel more at ease when I remove their driver
would be helpful.

The only practical (i.e. not armchair-psychology-based) use I can think
of is if someone is about to sit down and write a new driver they may
grep the tree for the name of the HW, and they may find the graveyard
entry. So I think listing the exact HW supported is useful. That said
as I'm writing this I'm reminded how old the hypothetical HW in the
previous sentence likely is.

I used the machine-readable format following CREDITS. I figured CREDITS
serves no practical purpose either today, in hindsight that's a bit
ahistoric.
