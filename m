Hello,

The patches in this series are mostly changes suggested by Daniel Vetter
to fix some race conditions that exists between the fbdev core (fbmem)
and sysfb with regard to device registration and removal.

For example, it is currently possible for sysfb to register a platform
device after a real DRM driver was registered and requested to remove the
conflicting framebuffers.

A symptom of this issue, was worked around with by commit fb561bf9abde
("fbdev: Prevent probing generic drivers if a FB is already registered")
but that's really a hack and should be reverted.

This series attempt to fix it more properly and revert the mentioned hack.
That will also unblock a pending patch to not make the num_registered_fb
variable visible to drivers anymore, since that's internal to fbdev core.

This is a v2 that addresses issues in v1 pointed out by Daniel.

Patch #1 is just a trivial preparatory change.

Patch #2 add sysfb_disable() and sysfb_try_unregister() helpers for fbmem
to use them.

Patch #3 changes how is dealt with conflicting framebuffers unregistering,
rather than having a variable to determine if a lock should be take, it
just drops the lock before unregistering the platform device.

Patch #4 fixes the mentioned race conditions and finally patch #5 is the
revert patch that was posted by Daniel before but he dropped from his set.

The patches were tested on a rpi4 using different video configurations:
(simpledrm -> vc4 both builtin, only vc4 builtin, only simpledrm builtin
and simpledrm builtin with vc4 built as a module).

Best regards,
Javier

Changes in v2:
- Rebase on top of latest drm-misc-next and fix conflicts (Daniel Vetter).
- Add kernel-doc comments and include in other_interfaces.rst (Daniel Vetter).
- Explain in the commit message that fbmem has to unregister the device
  as fallback if a driver registered the device itself (Daniel Vetter).
- Also explain that fallback in a comment in the code (Daniel Vetter).
- Don't encode in fbmem the assumption that sysfb will always register
  platform devices (Daniel Vetter).
- Add a FIXME comment about drivers registering devices (Daniel Vetter).
- Drop RFC prefix since patches were already reviewed by Daniel Vetter.
- Add Daniel Reviewed-by tags to the patches.
