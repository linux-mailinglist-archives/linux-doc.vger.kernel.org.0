Hi Adam,

Please find a couple of inline questions below from a casual user of
Sphinx via kernel documentation build tools.

So, can we assume that there won't be any backward-incompatible
behavior changes in Sphinx due to the removal of those long-deprecated
code?

Or do you mean that after the release of Sphinx 6, pre v3 Sphinx
will be removed in the PyPI repository?

These questions might be too obvious for you but I have no idea what
you mean by "removing support".

       Thanks, Akira
