record_lbr.sh was added 6 months ago, test_brstack.sh 3 years ago so 
it's the other way around.

Although record_lbr.sh also tests --call-graph and --stitch-lbr as well, 
so I think it's fine for test_brstack.sh to test only --branch-filter 
options at the lowest level.

Looking at that test though I see there is a capability 
"/sys/devices/cpu/caps/branches". I'm wondering whether we should be 
adding that on the Arm PMU for BRBE?

Ignoring the tests, the man pages (and some pages on the internet) give 
this example: "--branch-filter any_ret,u,k". This doesn't work either 
because it doesn't match the default exclude_hv option. It just seems a 
bit awkward and incompatible to me, for not much gain.

Perf script will show everything with all it's various options, or 
--branch-history on perf report will show both too. Also there are tools 
other than Perf, AutoFDO seems like something that BRBE can be used with.

Seeing the branch history from userspace that led up to a certain thing 
in the kernel happening doesn't seem like that much of an edge case to 
me. If you always have to have both on then you lose the userspace 
branch history because the buffer isn't that big and gets overwritten.

Does x86 leave holes in the program flow though, or is it complete? IMO 
it makes it harder for tools to make sense of the branch buffer if there 
are things like an ERET with no previous trap to match it up to.

In this patchset we enable PERF_BR_IRQ with PERF_SAMPLE_BRANCH_ANY, 
without any way to selectively disable it. I would assume trap could be 
done with the same option.

If we're filtering some of them out it might be worth documenting that 
"PERF_SAMPLE_BRANCH_ANY" doesn't actually mean 'any' branch type on Arm, 
and some types are recorded but discarded out before sending to userspace.

There could be some confusion when there are partially filled or empty 
branch buffers, and the reason wouldn't be that there weren't any 
branches recorded, but they were all filtered out even with the 'any' 
option.
