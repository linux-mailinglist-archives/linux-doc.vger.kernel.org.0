Hi Jakub,

Thank you for the patch.

Overall I think this is fine, but I'm a bit concerned it could be
interpreted too broadly. Brainstorming on mailing lists is hard, and
kernel communities often conduct technical discussions face to face, in
conferences or other events. Sometimes those discussions are as private
as they can get, I've found myself cycling multiple times to the office
of a fellow developer who happens to work close to my place in order to
discuss kernel API design in front of a white board. We did our best to
publish brainstorming notes on mailing lists, and patches are then of
course reviewed and further discussed in public. Is this a behaviour you
want to discourage, or is this considered fine ?
