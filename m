Global in the sense that there is only one struct pci_ser in the system.
There is no global variable for it though. It is created
pci_flb_preserve() when the first device is preserved (and destroyed
after the last device is unpreserved/cancelled).

So it's lifecycle is bound to the number of devices. It is maintained by
LUO (which does not know about devices, it just knows about files being
preserved). For the PCI FLB, each file happens to correspond to a device
(these are vfio-pci device files), but LUO doesn't need to know or care.

Yeah it is a cancel of the original request. I chose the name to match
the callback op that this function implements
(liveupdate_flb_ops.unpreserve).

At the Live Update Orchestrator level the PCI device preservation is
driven by userspace preserving files via ioctls. So that framing leaked
into this commit message. I will rephrase this to be more in the context
of devices that the PCI code actually cares about.

Pranjal raised this as well. Here was my reply:

.  Yes, it's possible to run out space to preserve devices if devices are
.  hot-plugged and then preserved. But I think it's better to defer
.  handling such a use-case exists (unless you see an obvious simple
.  solution). So far I am not seeing preserving hot-plugged devices
.  across Live Update as a high priority use-case to support.

I am going to add a comment here in the next revision to clarify that.
I will also add a comment clarifying why this code doesn't bother to
account for VFs created after this call (preserving VFs are explicitly
disallowed to be preserved in this patch since they require additional
support).

This WARN_ON (and the others you flagged) are all "this should never
happen" scenarios. For example if this triggers it means a bug somewhere
in the kernel (likely in LUO), or some sort of corruption.

Would you prefer I omit such WARNs or should I just a better
accompanying log message or comment?

LUO checks this when it receives preserved data from the previous kernel
and needs to hand it back to the users of that data. This prevents
passing binary data between 2 kernels that don't speak the same ABI.

Yes that's the only use-case in this series. I think there will be more
usecases in the future for checking if a device is outgoing (for example
in pci_device_shutdown() to avoid pci_clear_master()). I can defer
adding this bit for now if you prefer.

Yeah, the LUO FLB flow took me a little while to wrap my head around.

liveupdate_flb_get_outgoing() actually just returns the data
pci_flb_preserve() already allocated. It does not trigger
pci_flb_preserve().

pci_flb_preserve() is triggered when the first file is preserved, for
files that have registered their file handler with PCI
(pci_liveupdate_register_fh()).

So what happens in practice is:

 0. VFIO calls pci_liveupdate_register_fh(). This is what connects VFIO
    files with pci_liveupdate_flb.

 1. Userpace preserves a vfio-pci file using
    LIVEUPDATE_SESSION_PRESERVE_FD.

    a. If this is the first file to be preserved associated with
       pci_liveupdate_flb, then LUO will call pci_flb_preserve(). This
       allocates struct pci_ser.

    b. LUO calls VFIO preserve callback to preserve the VFIO device
       file.

    c. VFIO's preserve callback calls pci_liveupdate_outgoing_preserve()
       to notify PCI of which PCI device is getting preserved.

    c. pci_liveupdate_outgoing_preserve() calls
       liveupdate_flb_get_outgoing() to get the data allocated in (a).
       Note that this data may have been allocated a long time ago since
       (a) only happens when the first device is preserved.

(And note I am saying "first" but I really mean when the count goes from
0 to 1.)

It's kind of convoluted but it has some properties that I think make it
worth it:

 - It works for any kind of file (not just devices).

 - It allows other drivers to participate in PCI preservation by
   registering thier own file handler via pci_liveupdate_register_fh()
   (so it's not VFIO-specific).

 - The lifecycle is managed by LUO (create on first file preserve,
   destroy on last file unpreserve/cancel). So it avoids PCI subsystem
   having to maintain any global variables for struct pci_ser.

This is another "should never happen" guard.

Ack, I'll separate out the WARN.

Will do.

Will do.

Ack, I'll take this out of include/.

VFIO needs to know this before userspace retrieves the file associated
the preserved device from LUO. See patch 08:

This directory hosts all the ABI structures that are passed from
kernel-to-kernel across a Live Update.

  $ ls include/linux/kho/abi
  kexec_handover.h  luo.h  memblock.h  memfd.h  pci.h  vfio_pci.h

I agree the directory structure doesn't need to be quite so deep though.

Will do.

Thank you for the review!
