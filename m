I interpreted Peter's response differently.  I invited him to express
his opposition to *this patch* and he didn't do that.  As we know, Peter
does not suffer from an inability to express his thoughts explicitly and
succinctly; "implied NAK" is not normally his way.

Or are you saying that I should follow his message to the letter and
back out the entire RST conversion? :)
