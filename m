Great, thanks!

So this approach is more straightforward IMV and that's why I prefer it.

I'll need to revise the new flag description so it mentions the need
for a "matching" EM to produce reasonable results and there are a few
intel_pstate patches in-flight, so this one will need to be rebased.
It also needs a changelog, of course.

Fair enough.

Switching the governor (or policy if you will) to "performance" on any
CPU should cause eas_compatible to be cleared for it due to the
cpu->policy !=3D CPUFREQ_POLICY_PERFORMANCE check and then the scheduler
will refuse to use EAS after rebuilding the sched domains.

Or do you mean something else?

So it would be good to have some data indicating that it is beneficial
to use EAS when intel_pstate operates in the active mode ("powersave"
policy).

Also, enabling EAS by default for the active mode may be problematic
because people may see (and report) performance regressions due to it.
OTOH, EAS can be disabled via sysctl, so that may not be a big deal.
