Yes, and that would take care of making the uffd-wp bit persistent.

Once we figured out which other interfaces we have to deal with shared memory (minore(), lseek() as we learned), we might want to document that as well, to safe people some time when exploring this area.

You can also have is_none(pte) if it should be is_present(pte).

is_present(pte) is always correct when set, but might be wrong when not set.

There are other cases that don't require swapping I think (THP 
splitting). I might be wrong.

At this point I am pretty sure that the pagemap is the wrong mechanism 
for that. Pagemap never made that promise; it promised to tell you how 
the page tables currently look like, not the correct state of the 
underlying file.

As raised by Peter as well, there is much likely not a sane use case 
that should really rely on this. There might be corner cases (use case 
you mentioned), but that doesn't mean that we want to support them from 
a Linux ABI POV.

Or come to the conclusion that softdirty+shmem in the current form is 
the wrong approach and you actually want to maintain such information in 
central place, from where you can retrieve reliably if shared memory has 
been modified by any user.

pagemap never worked reliably with softdirty/swap/present on shmem, so 
it's not a regression. It was always best effort.
