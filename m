Thank you for working to improve our documentation!  I have a few
comments on this patch, though.

Please use scripts/get_maintainer.pl to generate the proper recipient
list for a patch.  I have added Thorsten, the author of the document you
are modifying, to the CC list here.  I am curious as to what led you to
add trivial@kernel.org?  We have not encouraged use of that address for
some years.

Please also consider your subject line; "LFX Task" is not meaningful to
anybody else, and will help nobody in the kernel change history.

There is no need to repeat all of the changes here - we can see those in
the patch itself.

Otherwise the actual changes look good.
