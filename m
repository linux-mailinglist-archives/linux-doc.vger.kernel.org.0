This is the proper Commonwealth spelling, last I knew, Neil lived in
Australia, and we do have a fair number of them, so I will let this
one be.  But yes, in perfbook, I would correct it.  ;-)

I confess .rst confusion.  I am not sure what this string is supposed
to replace nor what the "..." is supposed to be.  So could you please
send me a fixup patch for this change so that I can squash that patch
into Neil's original?

Fixed this as well, thank you!

This one I did change.  Neil owns the commit log, but yes, the file

This one could be argued, but the extra comma helps.

Looks that way to me, fixed.

I have a squash commit pending.  Please send me a patch for the
table-of-contents ":ref:" change.  And it looks like I should make
another try at getting "make htmldocs" running again...
