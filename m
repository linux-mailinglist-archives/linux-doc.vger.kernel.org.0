I've really wanted such things, but Linus has been pretty adamant about
not wanting to provide new "panic" paths (or even BUG usage[1]). It
seems that panic_on_warn remains the way to get this behavior,
with the understanding that WARN should only be produced on
expected-to-be-impossible situations[1].

Hitting a WARN while testing should result in either finding and fixing
a real bug, or removing the WARN in favor of pr_warn(). :)
