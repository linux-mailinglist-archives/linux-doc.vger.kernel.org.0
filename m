So I would argue that the admin guide (which is aimed at sysadmins) is the
wrong place for this document.  It's process information and is best placed
in the process manual (Documentation/process) IMO.  (Yes, I know
security-bugs.rst is in the admin guide; I remember there was a discussion
at the time and it ended up there, but I'm not really sure that's right
either).

I do think it could benefit from a pass for basic language issues; I can do
that if such an effort would be welcome.

I would de-hyphenate "mailing list" throughout.  But that's me.

Does the reporter get any say in who can be in this group?  That should
probably be made explicit either way.

Again, "should be informed" is conditional, suggesting that the reporter
might have some sort of veto power.  But the actual policy is not clear.

They will *agree to* adhere ...  We expect that actual adherence will be
the case but there is no way (even if an NDA were involved) to guarantee
that.

Do we want to envision a KPTI-like situation where the mitigation can be
developed publicly?  Or perhaps just handle any such case if and when it
ever arises?

Having companies without names seems a little weird.  Unless perhaps you
have people teed up to add their names in follow-on patches?

That URL is also in need of completion.

The topic of encrypted mailing lists is visited several times in this
document; I wonder if that could be coalesced somehow?

The "public key server" thing isn't working quite as well as it was; does
this requirement need to be revisited?
