Apologies, my previous explanation might not have been very clear.

For an entry to be written back, the shrinker must scan the *same* entry 
twice: the first scan sets referenced to false and returns ROTATE, and 
only during the second scan can it be written back.

If a swap entry is zswapin'd between the first and second scan (meaning 
the entry is no longer on the zswap LRU), then this swap entry will not 
be written back by the shrinker. Therefore, the second scan must occur 
before this entry is zswapin'd for it to be possible to be written back.
So, if the baseline scanning speed is far slower than the lifecycle 
speed of the swap entries, it results in only scanning once. In the 
baseline kernel, 99.21% of the return values of shrink_memcg_cb() are 
LRU_ROTATE, while the patched kernel's shrink_worker() scans at least 64 
* 16 entries in a single pass, resulting in only 58.7% of the return 
values of shrink_memcg_cb() being LRU_ROTATE.

              Baseline         Patched
---------------------------------------------------
zswapin       929,096          281,196   <----
zswapout      982,731        1,058,746

After modifying the kernel to remove the "second chance" algorithm, the 
test data of the baseline kernel roughly conforms to our expectations.

Therefore, the constructed test has a bit of a problem. The second test 
case in my previous email can ensure that the entries on the zswap LRU 
are relatively stable.



It is worth noting that the capacity of the zswap pool will not remain 
constant all the time. Since stress-ng periodically writes to and reads 
from this 4G memory, accessing the pages in the zswap pool will trigger 
zswapin, causing the zswap pool size to decrease. Other pages attempting 
to zswapout into zswap via zswap_store() will fail (until the zswap pool 
size becomes 160M (accept_threshold_percent=50)), but the zswap_store() 
path will wake up shrink_worker() to try to perform scanning and 
writeback. Then stress-ng will continue to read and write memory, 
continuously triggering zswapin to further reduce the zswap pool size 
until the threshold, at which point shrink_memcg() will also stop. Then, 
new zswap entries (with referenced as true) are added to the zswap LRU 
again via zswap_store(), until the zswap pool size reaches 320MB (32 GB 
(Total memory) * 1%). This process repeats continuously during the test.

Thanks,
Hao
