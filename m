Hey Evan,

do you have anything against using this code:

static const unsigned int riscv_zvbb_bundled_exts[] = {
	RISCV_ISA_EXT_ZVKB,
	RISCV_ISA_EXT_ZVBB
};

...

Then declaring zvbb like that:

__RISCV_ISA_EXT_BUNDLE(zvbb, riscv_zvbb_bundled_exts),

I agree that it is *not* a bundled extension but it actually already
works with Conor's code. Not sure that adding more code is needed to
handle that case.

Clément
