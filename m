Exactly.

I do not think that this is a big problem. As you write below, it is
a debug feature. IMHO, people debugging boot problems won't mind when
the delay continues beyond SYSTEM_RUNNING. And if anyone complains
than we would at least know that there are people using this feature ;-)

The unconditional delay does not make much sense. I consider it a bug.

Sounds good.

Good point! I thought that mdelay() can be used even for the early
messages because parse_early_param() is called right before
parse_args() in start_kernel() in init/main.c.

But parse_early_param() might be called even earlier, for example,
by setup_arch in arch/x86/kernel/setup.c. And it is called before

  + tsc_early_init()
    + tsc_enable_sched_clock()
      + loops_per_jiffy = get_loops_per_jiffy()

which seems to be used by

  + mdelay()
    + udelay()
      + __const_udelay()

Anyway, it has to be done before printk_delay_msec() can be set
via an early parameter.

> If that makes sense I can fashion a patchset.

That would be great.

PS: Note that I am traveling the following week so my review might
    get delayed.
