I guess that should be straight forward as long as it's done at the point of

transition except if it's done by a filesystem instead of the VFS (maybe 
require

a helper be used ...). Might be a bit harder for dentries that don't 
transition

(ie. ENOENT lookups that start out and stay negative) might escape the 
needed

handling.

Only catch there is the number of positive children might be large as well.

Yep, the notion of a cursor is a good idea.


Nevertheless the challenge is to identify dentries that should be discarded

rather than kept at final dput() in addition to what we already have in 
dout()

but there doesn't seem to be anything sensible to add to those checks.


On a different note another possibility to identify candidates to discard on

traversals might be a ttl, basically an extension of the referenced 
flag. The

dentry d_time field could be used for that but only for negative 
dentries since,

IIRC, nfs uses that dentry field.


But now I'm not sure I'm making sense as a couple of your comments sound 
like

they refer to a discussion I'm not aware of, ;)
