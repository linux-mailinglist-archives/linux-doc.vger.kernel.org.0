Thank you for acknowledging.  I'm hoping this to land on 7.2-rc1.

Good point, you are right.

I agree.

I guess it is hopefully true, for following reason.

The score for each region is calculated as a weigted sum of the access
frequency and the age of the region.  To avoid DAMOS action is repeatedly
applied to only a few regions, we reset age of regions after a DAMOS action is
applied to the region, regardless of the action failure.  So, periodically the
score of the regions having the action unapplicable region will get low, make
no big impact to the minimum score threshold calculation.

But real data could say something different.  I will be happy to be proven
wrong my real data. :)

Indeed.  Thank you for pointing out.  Nonetheless this is not a new issue that
introduced by this patch series.  And the impact is not clear at the moment.  I
will be happy to revisit this in parallel to this patch series.


Thanks,
SJ
