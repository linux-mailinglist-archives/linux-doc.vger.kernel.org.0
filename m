Thank you so much for your encouragement. I was truly happy to receive your reply.
Namhyung also offered a lot of encouragement through discord. :)

I also appreciate you taking the time to read through my lengthy mail.

I've currently added Namhyung, Ian, and Arnaldo as owners on perfwiki Github.
Feel free to update the perfwiki markdown contents whenever it’s convenient for you.

I'm open to receiving contributions via GitHub Pull Requests
Link: https://github.com/perfwiki/main/pulls

Similarly, if someone have any discussions or requests, anyone can leave them as issues
Link: https://github.com/perfwiki/main/issues
or contact me via email.

I’ve written a guide on this topic in the README.md file.

I took some time to review the deployment process for MkDocs.
Link: https://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/deploying-your-docs/#project-pages

The branch used for deploying to the actual website is this one: "gh-pages" branch.
Link: https://github.com/perfwiki/main/tree/gh-pages

You can make changes to the markdown files in "main" branch directly.
I’ve already deleted the site directory from the main branch where I
previously made an incorrect push.

Thank you for your feedback. Once the mirroring to GitLab is set up as planned,
it will be even better, as anyone will be able to access the repository even
if GitHub is down. :)

Yes, as you mentioned, I will make the issue entries I identified during this
migration as issues so that others can be informed as well.

Thank you Ian for providing the reference information. It would be great
to have a guide with improved accessibility and easily accessible questions,
similar to "libbpf" project. Going forward, when issues arise, I plan to refer
to how popular opensource projects label issues for open source contributors.

You're right. I completely agree. It's definitely best to avoid external dependencies.
Currently, there’s no specific packaging plan, and I’m just planning to link to the perf man
documentation in the kernel repository for now.

If you think there’s anything else I should work on or if I missed something, please let me know.

Thank you for taking the time to read my long email.

Please feel free to reach out anytime.

Best regards,
Yunseong Kim
