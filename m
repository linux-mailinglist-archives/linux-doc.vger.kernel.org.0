The state-dependent Z/P view and SVCR.ZA gating make sense to me, and
lossless: the inaccessible state is only reachable via an SM/ZA
transition, which zeroes the affected registers.

Single finalisation via KVM_ARM_VCPU_VEC makes sense too: splitting it
would leave the SVE registers writable while their VL could still
move.

Unrelated: on the get-reg-list restructuring you mention deferring to
a separate series: since ZA, ZT0 and SME_VLS are the
migration-critical SME state, it'd be good if that series also covered
a save/restore round-trip for them, not just get-reg-list enumeration.

Cheers,
/fuad
