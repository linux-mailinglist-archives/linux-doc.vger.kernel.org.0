OK, we're getting closer, but there are still some learning opportunites
here...:)  The first of these is that it would be best to split these into
independent patches so that they can be considered separately; we'll see
why.

This one is good.

This one is already fixed in docs-next.

This one, instead, is fixed in the DRM tree; you would have seen that had
you looked in linux-next.  That's one of the challenges of the docs
"subsystem" - it gets touched from all over.

The correct fix here was to add the missing document; that was done in
docs-next a couple of weeks or so ago.

This one seems good.  But it's always worth doing a bit of digging to
figure out how something came to be...in this case, the rio driver was
deleted and wusbcore went into staging:

	015664d15270 USB: rio500: Remove Rio 500 kernel driver
	71ed79b0e4be USB: Move wusbcore and UWB to staging as it is obsolete

Submitting those separately with Fixes: tags would be good.

This goes with the wusb change as well.

I do appreciate your working to make the documentation better, sorry it can
be so painful to get started...

Thanks,
