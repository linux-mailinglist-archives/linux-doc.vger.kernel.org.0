But it isn't. A GPU is a device that has a kernel-arbitrated MMU
hosting kernel-managed buffers, executes user-supplied compiled
programs with reference to those buffers and other jobs, and informs
the kernel about progress.

KMS lies under the same third-level directory, but even when GPU and
display are on the same die, they're totally different IP blocks
developed on different schedules which are just periodically glued
together.

Why not? All we have in common in GPU land right now is MMU + buffer
references + job scheduling + synchronisation. None of this has common
top-level API, or even a common top-level model. It's not just ISA
differences, but we have very old-school devices where the kernel
needs to register fill on every job, living next to middle-age devices
where the kernel and userspace co-operate to fill a ring buffer,
living next to modern devices where userspace does some stuff and then
the hardware makes it happen with the bare minimum of kernel
awareness.

Honestly I think there's more difference between lima and amdgpu then
there is between amdgpu and current NN/ML devices.

Cheers,
Daniel
