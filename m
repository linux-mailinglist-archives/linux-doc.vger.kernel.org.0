The documentation looks really nice and helpful. Some very minor nits

How about "When the CTI trigger connection information is unavailable,
the driver detects the number of triggers and channels from the DEVID
register and makes them available. The Integration Control registers
can be then used to discover the connections for this CTI device
to other CoreSight components".

Since we recommend the use of the "Integration Control registers", which
is not normally available unless you play around the code, it will be a
good idea to metion, what the user needs to do to make the registers
available. (One more reason to use the CONFIG symbol, makes that
easier.)

If possible, please could we make this :

I understand these bindings have been around for quite long and is too
late to make any changes. So, feel free to ignore this suggestion below
and I am perfectly fine with it.

--- Begin silly comments Or Skip to DONE ----

Could we make the property names a bit more obvious ? Since they are 
supposed to be written by other people (unlike our variable names), it
always makes sense to have expanded, meaningful names:

s/trig_conns@/triggers@ ?

s/arm,trig-{in,out}-sigs/arm,cti-{in,out}-triggers
s/arm,trig-{in,out}-types/arm,cti-{in,out}-trigger-types

"arm,trig-xxx" property name doesn't really imply that it is for cti.
So, the above changes makes it explicit and more reader friendly.
