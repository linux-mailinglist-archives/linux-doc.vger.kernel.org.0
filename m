Think of those tones as just different frequencies (the other stuff could be the same)
then this is FSK with 8 symbols.

If you are only configuring the one that is active, short of a small overhead
of having to configure more than one property why have this at all?

Just leave it in a profile and have userspace reconfigure everything it wants to.

However, I see that in some of them modes below this is more complex
as the profiles are cycled through - for ram playback anyway.
It may make sense to separate the ram case from tone ones.

No, I mean having more channels.  One for each of polar, frequency, phase and frequency for
each channel.  Then enables for which channel is turned on.  Might not work out,
but I'd like you to explore what problems that type of interface would bring.

The aim here is to add as little new ABI as possible as custom ABI is a real
pain for generic userspace.

So is it worth exposing this software control at all?  Maybe just make it a firmware
description problem as to whether that DRCTL is connected or not.

Sawtooth is kind of a special triangle wave with one very steep side.
Wikipedia even has: "It can also be considered the extreme case of an asymmetric triangle wave"
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sawtooth_wave

Let us see if we can get more opinions on this.  Whilst I can see the logic of
the datasheet naming, it's a bit obscure.

Ah. This reflects on the profile control above. As I mention there I'm not sure we
shouldn't separate the use of profile for tones (where it is symbol like) to that
for RAM addresses.

For the ram addresses I think I'd expose separate attributes for each (there aren't
that many) rather than a selector + controls.

Another option would be to push the control of this into the firmware files
(some sort of header).  Whether that is sufficient would depend on the usecases
for the device.  It would definitely make for an easier runtime configuration
though!

They had fun designing this didn't they!

Anyhow, I think we'll need to work through a few more versions of this to get
as extensible an interface as possible.
