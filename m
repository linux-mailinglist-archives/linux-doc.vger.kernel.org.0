Yes, that works too. Probably then we should just keep as is and then as a follow
up we can add another helper to include/linux/ioport.h to avoid having something
that's only for the aperture helpers.

I don't know to be honest.

Ok, I was wondering what was the value of the indirection level other than
making the code more complex and supporting an hypothetical case of a FW
driver that would not bind against a platform device.

But if the goal is to move this at some point to a more generic place (i.e:
the Linux device model itself) then I agree that we can just keep it as is.

When you re-spin this patch, feel free to add my R-b since looks good to me.

And thanks again for working on this!
