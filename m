Just clarify a bit to make sure us on the same page.

This series does not break timestamp functionality, it just changes the
PMU format 'timestamp' from 1-bit to 4-bits for counter support.  The
updated 'timestamp' format still supports per-thread mode and CPU wise
trace modes.

The only difference is now users need to specify 'cs_etm/timestamp=1/'
rather than 'cs_etm/timestamp/' when enabling timestamp.  Given PMU
format is not an ABI, it is fine for me for the updated format.

To avoid confusion for users, a well-written document is deserved —
which is exactly this patch for.  And perf log would be helpful.  I
think we are well prepared for the change.

Thanks,
Leo
