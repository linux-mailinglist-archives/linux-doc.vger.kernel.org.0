The onus is on you to substantiate this claim. I would imagine after
carrying the revert for so long that there must be at least one example
of such a guest?

What ifs and maybes do not meet the bar, in my opinion, for preserving
bug emulation in KVM. Of course there could be a little flexibility with
that but we need to have some way of discriminating between bug fixes
and genuine guest expectations around the behavior of virtual hardware.

That's exactly it, and why I said tying up UAPI opt-in with
guest-visible registers is a really bad idea.

As I described earlier, this whole IIDR crap inarguably broke UAPI and
obviously normal guest behavior (i.e. reading the register). At minimum
we need to permit previously-valid values for IIDR, even if they carry
no implied behaviors.

That is the nature of a bug fix. If you can provide some concrete
evidence of a guest depending on the RAZ/WI behavior then I agree we
need to preserve the old behavior.

Otherwise I see this as a matter of principle in how we do bug fixes to
KVM. Even if upstream took the strictest possible stance towards behavior
changes we will invariably fail to account for some minutia.

Left as documented, yes. With the exception that revision == 1 writes
not be considered opt-in to restorable IGROUPR.

Thanks,
Oliver
