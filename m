The big advantage of combining the counters is that all of the state is
explicit and visible in one place.  Plus it can be accessed atomically.
And it avoids setting a time bomb for some poor guys just trying to get
their idle-loop jobs done some time in the dim distant future.

Besides, this pair of patches already makes a large change from a
conceptual viewpoint.  If we are going to make a large change, let's
get our money's worth out of that change!
