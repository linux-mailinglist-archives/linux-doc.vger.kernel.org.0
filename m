Yeah, I don't think it is worth it.

I don't think we need to be squeezing every ounce of performance out
of unit tests, since they are inherently a cost and are not intended
to be run in a production deployed kernel as part of normal production
usage.

Fair enough, I can see the point of not wanting to use irq disabled
until we get someone complaining about it, but I think making it
thread safe is reasonable. It means there is one less thing to confuse
a KUnit user and the only penalty paid is some very minor performance.
