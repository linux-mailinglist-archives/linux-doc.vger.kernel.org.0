Agreed - I think the expansion got lost in the many re-arrangement of this doc.

Agreed - need to explain the use case for this and implications of

Per my comments to Rob, the v8-cti case will be a compatible option,
so this will disappear as an attribute.

I appreciate the comments on naming, but my feeling is to
differentiate between the trigger signals and the trigger connections
group. hence the sub-node has group trig_cons.
I was hoping that users would get that these are CTI related by the
fact that the root node is cti@...
