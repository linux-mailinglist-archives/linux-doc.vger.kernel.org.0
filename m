(+1) to this. I too prefer the site navigation of RTD over Alabaster.

Adding to what Akira says, what I really would like to see is a TOC in the
sidebar that shows all parts, with the current part expanded at all times.
For instance, the sidebar should expand and appear as follows when
I click the KUnit documentation's main index page:

KUnit - Linux Kernel Unit Testing
      Getting Started
      KUnit Architecture
      Run tests with KUnit
      Introduction
      Unit Testing

When the 'Introduction' item is  selected, the toc in the sidebar should get
updated as follows:

KUnit - Linux Kernel Unit Testing
Getting Started
KUnit Architecture
Run tests with KUnit
Introduction
    Features
    Prerequisites
Unit Testing

Currently, only the second-level headings exhibit the above behaviour,
as seen here:
https://static.lwn.net/kerneldoc/dev-tools/index.html

Applying this to third-level headings, which are significant in KUnit
docs, would be helpful.
It will make it easier for us to always know where we are
on this website because it displays the parent, sibling, and child
nodes of the current
page.
