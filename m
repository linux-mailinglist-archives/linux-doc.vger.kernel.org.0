There are behavioural requirements on the seq_file next() function in
terms of how it updates *pos at end-of-file, and these are now enforced
by a warning.

I was recently attempting to justify the reason this was needed, and
couldn't remember the details, and didn't find them in the
documentation.

So I re-read the code until I understood it again, and updated the
documentation to match.

I also enhanced the text about SEQ_START_TOKEN as it seemed potentially
misleading.

+The next() function should set ``*pos`` to a value that start() can use
+to find the new location in the sequence.  When the iterator is being
+stored in the private data area, rather than being reinitialized on each
+start(), it might seem sufficient to simply set ``*pos`` to any non-zero
+value (zero always tells start() to restart the sequence).  This is not
+sufficient due to historical problems.

+Historically, many next() functions have *not* updated ``*pos`` at
+end-of-file.  If the value is then used by start() to initialise the
+iterator, this can result in corner cases where the last entry in the
+sequence is reported twice in the file.  In order to discourage this bug
+from being resurrected, the core seq_file code now produces a warning if
+a next() function does not change the value of ``*pos``.  Consequently a
+next() function *must* change the value of ``*pos``, and of course must
+set it to a non-zero value.

 The stop() function closes a session; its job, of course, is to clean
 up. If dynamic memory is allocated for the iterator, stop() is the
 place to free it; if a lock was taken by start(), stop() must release
