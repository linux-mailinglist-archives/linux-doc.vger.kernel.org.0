I guess revert what we did (unpin) and return an error. The interesting ques=
tion is what can make migration/isolation fail

a) out of memory: smells like a zone setup issue. Failures are acceptable I g=
uess.

b) short term pinnings: process dying - not relevant I guess. Other cases? (=
Fork?)

c) ?

Once we clarified that, we actually know how likely it will be to return an e=
rror (and making vfio pinnings fail etc).
