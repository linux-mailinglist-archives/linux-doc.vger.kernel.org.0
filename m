Having had a look through, thoughts:

I'm very concerned that this (whether intended or not) is a work around for
drivers to get access to symbols that are not exported.

In many cases you are adding meminspect instrumentation for stuff that's already
exported (fine). In some cases it's stuff that's only GPL-exported (not fine),
and in some cases you are exporting totally unexpected symbols (very very very
not fine).

A driver that hooks on to meminspect then gets the PA and VA for these and can
access these symbols as far as I can tell.

On that basis I really question the whole approach. It feels like you want to
have essentially richer symbol information here, so the approach should perhaps
be built on the existing mechanism for symbols rather than arbitrarily +
invasively stuck into core kernel logic?

I am also concerned that you're not accounting for memory lifecycle or things
like memory hotplug - you seem to just store PAs/VAs with assumption that the
ranges remain eternally mapped at the same ranges for both.

This is a concern because you also track dynamic ranges, and drivers might
register stuff they allocate this way, and it all seems like an easy way to get
UAF's.

I may have missed something here and happy to be corrected, though.

In general the series is far from being in upstreamable shape - you send a giant
1st patch which lumps together a whole bunch of stuff, then you send dozens of
2-5 line patches, and finally include some qualcomm driver specific stuff for
good measure.

The commit messages are generally awful and give little to no information, the
cover letter is deeply uncompelling and doesn't make the case for the feature at
all.

You make zero comments about key concerns with regards to stability, robustness,
security. There's no testing logic anywhere, and you even include a plea for
testing in the cover letter.

This is very much RFC stuff and I continue to not understand why you've taken
the RFC label off here.

And it all very much smacks of trying to solve an internal problem you've
encountered downstream by changing the core of the kernel, rather than you
sending a generally useful feature.

You need to address all of this and re-RFC the series. It instinctively feels
like trying to solve the problem in the wrong place, but in any case it would be
better to start with a SMALLER version of this first then look to extend it only
if the community supports it.

Thanks, Lorenzo

> >  - Fixed doc warnings
> >  - Fixed kernel-test robot warnings.

> > Changelog for meminspect v1:
>
> You don't include a link to RFC v3 at all?
>
> > - rename to meminspect
> > - start on top of v2 actually, with the section and all.
> > - remove the backend thing, change the API to access the table
> > - move everything to kernel/
> > - add dependency to CRASH_DUMP instead of a separate knob
> > - move the minidump driver to soc/qcom
> > - integrate the meminspect better into memblock by using a new memblock flag
> > - minor fixes : use dev_err_probe everywhere, rearrange variable declarations,
> > remove some useless code, etc.

> > Changelog for RFC v3:
> > - V2 available here : https://lore.kernel.org/all/20250724135512.518487-1-eugen.hristev@linaro.org/
>
> Same comment as below. Put links for changelogs with the version you're changing
> it's a total nightmare trying to follow this.
>
> And I literally cannot find RFC v3 on list, did you mislabel it?
>
> > - Removed the .section as requested by David Hildenbrand.
> > - Moved all kmemdump registration(when possible) to vmcoreinfo.
> > - Because of this, some of the variables that I was registering had to be non-static
> > so I had to modify this as per David Hildenbrand suggestion.
> > - Fixed minor things in the Kinfo driver: one field was broken, fixed some
> > compiler warnings, fixed the copyright and remove some useless includes.
> > - Moved the whole kmemdump from drivers/debug into mm/ and Kconfigs into mm/Kconfig.debug
> > and it's now available in kernel hacking, as per Randy Dunlap review
> > - Reworked some of the Documentation as per review from Jon Corbet
> >
> > Changelog for RFC v2:
> > - V1 available here: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20250422113156.575971-1-eugen.hristev@linaro.org/
>
> Why are you linking the previous version here, it's strange.
>
> Just put RFC v1: with the link below, same goes for other cases.
>
> > - Reworked the whole minidump implementation based on suggestions from Thomas Gleixner.
> > This means new API, macros, new way to store the regions inside kmemdump
> > (ditched the IDR, moved to static allocation, have a static default backend, etc)
> > - Reworked qcom_minidump driver based on review from Bjorn Andersson
> > - Reworked printk log buffer registration based on review from Petr Mladek.
