Thanks.

Yes, we're at -rc7 and this series is rather in panic mode and it seems
unnecessarily risky so I'm inclined to set it aside for this cycle.

If the series is considered super desirable and if people are confident
that we can address any remaining glitches during two months of -rc
then sure, we could push the envelope a bit.  But I don't believe this
is the case so I'm thinking let's give ourselves another cycle to get
this all sorted out?
