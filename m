Rejecting ones that produce no samples is fair enough, but my example 
does produce samples. To answer the question "why would we want that?", 
nothing major, but there are a few small reasons:

  * Perf includes both user and kernel by default, so the shortest
    command to only gather user branches doesn't work (-j any,u)
  * The test already checks for branch stack support like this, so old
    Perf test versions don't work
  * You might only be optimising userspace, but still interested in the
    proportion of time spent or particular place in the kernel
  * Consistency with existing implementations and for people porting
    existing tools to Arm
  * It doesn't cost anything to support it (I think we just
    only check if exclude_* is set rather than !=)
  * Permissions checks should be handled by the core code so that
    they're consistent
  * What's the point of separate branch filters anyway if they always
    have to match the event filter?

Some of these things could be fixed in Perf, but not in older versions. 
Even if we can't think of a real use case now, it doesn't sound like the 
driver should be so restrictive of an option that doesn't do any harm.

The test is doing this rather than a syscall:

   asm("mrs %0, ID_AA64ISAR0_EL1" : "=r" (val));   /* TRAP + ERET */

So I think trap is right. Whether that should be mapped to SYSCALL or 
some other branch type I don't know, but the point is that it's missing now.
