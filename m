In general, if a workflow is expected by a subsystem, it should be
documented. I don't see much to be gained from not telling submitters
what they're expecting to do.

More precisely in this case, as a submitter, I would take it pretty
badly if I was told to act on the output of a tool that is prone to
hallucinations without a maintainer first triaging the comments.
