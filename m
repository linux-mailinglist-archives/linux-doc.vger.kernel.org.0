I am not much knowledgeable with BPF, so, I might be wrong here.

There are couple of things which might not be addressed with BPF:
1. Which controller to use in v1 case? These are not abstract resources
   so in v1 where each controller have their own hierarchy it might not
   be easy to identify the best controller.

2. It seems to me that we won't be able to abstract out a single BPF
   program which can help with all of the resources types we are
   planning to use, again, because it is not an abstract type like
   network packets, and there will be different places in the source
   code to use these resources.

To me a cgroup tends to give much easier and well integrated solution when it
comes to scheduling and limiting a resource with existing tools in a
cloud infrastructure.

I see, I will change it to GPL.
