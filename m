I guess the problem is that Rajendra is currently planning to remove
all the "dynamic-power-coefficient" values from device tree right now
and move them to the source code because the numbers we currently have
in the device tree _are_ in abstract scale and thus violate the
bindings.  Moving this to source code won't help us get to more real
power numbers (since it'll still be abstract scale), it'll just be
pure churn.  If we're OK with the abstract scale in general then we
should allow it everywhere and not add churn for no reason.

There are some important differences:

a) Your comment is gone when the device tree is compiled.  If we
actually add a string to the device tree then, in theory, we can add
conversions in code (without touching the device tree) down the road.

b) I believe there can be more than one abstract scale present in a
single device tree, at least in theory.  Adding a string allows you to
know if you're comparing apples to apples or apples to organges.

I can if needed, but I'd kinda like to get the above resolved first
since it feels like it could have an effect on the other patches?
