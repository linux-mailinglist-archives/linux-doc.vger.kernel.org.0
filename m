Nope. It just means you wont be able to use drm-only userspace with it
most likely, without also investing a ton of effort into porting those
over.

We support drm_fourcc, so adding more pixel formats is not problem at all.
Anything indexed/paletted will simply not work great with unchanged drm
userspace, because you can't really convert it over from the common
denominator of xrgb888. But if it's just about adding support, adding more
fourcc codes isn't a big deal. The fbdev layer hasn't been taught about
fourcc codes yet, but that's also just for lack of need by anyone.

Also we support abitrary uneven pixel packing too, with some generic
support for anything that's at least somewhat regular. That's been the
case for a while now. It was added for fancy tiling and compression
formats, but works equally well for anything else that's aligned different
than what can be described with simplistic bytes-per-pixel only.
