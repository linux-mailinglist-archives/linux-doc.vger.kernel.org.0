Since 89a6a5e56c82("regulator: add property parsing and callbacks to set protection limits")
which introduced a warning:

Documentation/driver-api/regulator:166: ./include/linux/regulator/driver.h:96: WARNING: Unexpected indentation.
Documentation/driver-api/regulator:166: ./include/linux/regulator/driver.h:98: WARNING: Block quote ends without a blank line; unexpected unindent.

Let's fix them.

v2:
* Add blankline.
* a text Block which should begins with a "-", followd by whitespace.

v1:
* regulato: remove unnecessary indentation from driver.h's comments
