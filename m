Actually, looking into the crypto API side, I don't see how they can
get out of order since commit 81760ea6a95a ("crypto: cryptd - Add
helpers to check whether a tfm is queued"):

    [...] ensure that no reordering is introduced because of requests
    queued in cryptd with respect to requests being processed in
    softirq context.

And cryptd_aead_queued() is used by AESNI (via simd_aead_decrypt()) to
decide whether to process the request synchronously or not.

So I really don't get what commit ab046a5d4be4 was trying to fix. I've
never been able to reproduce that issue, I guess commit 81760ea6a95a
explains why.

I'd suggest to revert commit ab046a5d4be4, but it feels wrong to
revert it without really understanding what problem Scott hit and why
81760ea6a95a didn't solve it.

What do you think?
