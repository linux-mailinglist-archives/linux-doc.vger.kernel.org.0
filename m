Ooof, this is really a lot for one patch. Makes it hard to review. 500 lines in
a patch is much easier to digest.

But before commenting on the details of the code I have some more high-level
comments. As I mentioned in my reply to the cover letter, I've gone through the
exercise of writing some motor control divers in the Linux kernel that have been
used by 1000s of people that used them to build everything imaginable using LEGO
robotics over the last 10+ years.

From what I see here (I didn't have time to really get into the details of it
yet, so maybe missed some important details), it looks like you are trying to
do motor control stuff in the kernel so that the interface for a basic H-bridge
will be close to the same as a fancy stepper motor controller. We tried doing
something very similar because it sounds like a really nice thing to do. The
kernel does everything and makes it really easy for the users. But what we
actually found is that it is not possible to make a solution in the kernel that
can handle every possible use case. In the end, we wished that we had a much
more low-level interface to the motor controllers to give us more flexibility
for the many different types of applications this ended up getting used for.
Having to modify the kernel for your use case is too high of a bar for most
users and not practical even if you are a kernel hacker.

When writing kernel drivers for this sort of thing, I think the rule of thumb
should be to keep the driver as "thin" as possible. If the hardware doesn't
provide a feature, the kernel should not be trying to emulate it. So for an
H-bridge I would want something that just provides a way to tell it I want
fast-decay mode with some normalized duty cycle between -1 and 1 (obviously we
will have to multiply this by some factor since the kernel doesn't do floating
point). A duty cycle of 0 will "brake" the motor. And then we would need one
more control parameter to tell it to remove power completely to "coast" the
motor. I guess this is what the "basic_run" and "basic_stop" are other than
the run seems to have speed instead of duty cycle? The kernel shouldn't be
trying to convert this duty cycle to speed or have a background task that tries
to provide an acceleration profile or turn off the power after some time. Just
let the kernel provide direct, low-level access to the hardware and let
userspace handle all of the rest in a way that makes the most sense for the
specific application. Sometimes they might not even be connected to a motor!
With the LEGO MINDSTORMS and BeableBone Blue, the H-bridge outputs are
hot-pluggable, so they can even be connected to things like LEDs or used as a
general power supply. (A reason to call this subsystem "actuation" rather than
"motion".)

Another way of putting this is that it was very tempting to model the actual
motor in the kernel. But that didn't work well because there are so many
different kinds of motors and related mechanical systems that you can connect
to the same motor driver chip. So the driver really should just be for the
H-bridge chip itself and not care about the motor. And the rest can be put in
a libmotion userspace library and have that be the convenient API for users
that want to get something up and running quickly.
