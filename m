Good point!

Another use case: - can simulate generic block device with different type
with different parameters easily

Yeah, because io_uring passthrough is proved to be very efficient.

OK, we can add the words, but it is usually one common sense since
userspace is independent with kernel.

For the sake of simplicity, I will use ublksrv or ublk server to represent any
userspace application of ublk.

In short, one buffer is dedicated for one single tag/slot, either in driver
side or userspace side. In kernel side, the buffer is used/prepared for
accepting new io request. In userspace side, it is used for handling
the io request. And that is how UBLK_IO_COMMIT_AND_FETCH_REQ is
defined.

Yeah, it is pre-allocation of virtual memory, but pages are just allocated
when the buffer/IO is used. If the buffer isn't used for long enough
period(so far it is set as 20sec), ublksrv will discard these pages via
madvise(DONT_NEED), so swap out isn't involved usually.
