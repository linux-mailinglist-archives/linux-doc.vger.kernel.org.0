Hm... so I'm not quite happy with those two paragraphs, but I'm not sure
how to make it better.

- While the origins of virtio are hypervisor implementations, the
  standard is describing the mechanisms of device <-> driver
  communication, regardless whether the device is a hardware entity or
  something emulated by a hypervisor.
- I'm not quite sure what you are referring to with "real host
  devices". We can have e.g. a real disk that is handed to a guest via
  virtio-blk as a whole, or we can have some kind of file that is
  exposed via virtio-blk. Other device types can also be completely
  emulated.
- The OS picks the driver depending on what device is discovers; virtio
  device drivers are not any different from other device drivers in that
  regard.

So I think the key pieces of virtio are the following:

- it is an open standard
- it describes a protocol, which can be used to implement a lot of
  different device types
- those devices are exposed to the operating system via standard
  mechanisms such as PCI
- virtio devices can be implemented in various ways, such as in
  hypervisors (more common) or as a real hardware device

For the remainder of this document, it is probably fine to focus on the
hypervisor use case.

See my comments above, virtio devices can also be fully emulated or real
hardware devices.

I think we should not make any statement regarding frequency of new
additions; sometimes, there's a flurry of activity, sometimes, there's
nothing for ages :)

Maybe "Device ids need to be at least reserved in the virtio spec before
being added to that file." ?
