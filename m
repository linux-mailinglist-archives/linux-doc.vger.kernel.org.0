Hi SJ,

One layering question I'd like to flag before the plan is written,
since it affects how this RFC's substrate slots in:

  In [3], .apply_probes is a periodic per-region classifier driven
  from kdamond_fn after .check_accesses, in process context, that
  applies a (folio -> bool) predicate to each region's sampling_addr
  and accounts the results in r->probe_hits[].  damon_report_access()
  on the other hand is a per-event delivery callback into a per-CPU
  buffer, called from the access source (NMI for IBS / PEBS / SPE,
  process context for page-fault-based sources).  These appear to
  me to sit at different layers - delivery vs. classification.

  The reason I want to confirm this: NMI context for HW samplers
  precludes the operations .apply_probes can do today (no mutex, no
  kmalloc, no sleep, no folio lookup that touches pte_lock).  And
  the data shape is inverted - .apply_probes asks "does region R's
  sampling_addr have attribute A?", evaluated on the kdamond-chosen
  address; an HW sample announces "PA Y was accessed at retirement
  time T", arriving asynchronously and needing to find the region
  it falls into.  If access events end up routed through
  .apply_probes in the long-term plan, the IBS / PEBS / SPE
  backends would each need a deferral path under it (per-CPU ring
  for NMI-safe submission, region mapping at drain time).

  Happy to be wrong here if you see a unified shape that handles
  both - just want to surface the constraint before the plan is
  written.

On the loadable-module question for patches 1 and 2: agreed it's a
genuinely open architectural call, not just a paddr_ibs convenience.

  - paddr_ibs (this RFC) targets the existing IBS Op facility on
    Zen 3+ silicon via the perf event subsystem and uses a
vendor-specific
    overflow-handler filter that perf_event_attr cannot express
    (dc_phy_addr_valid in IBS_OP_DATA3).  Bharata's pghot v7
    [pghot-v7] introduces a separate IBS driver targeting the new
IBS-MProf
    facility on future AMD silicon via direct MSR programming -
    not perf at all.  These are two AMD-specific HW samplers with
    non-overlapping silicon coverage and non-overlapping kernel
    paths.  A distro shipping a single kernel image to a fleet
    with mixed silicon needs runtime-selectable backends, which
    obj=3Dy can't do across exclusive `depends on` chains.
  - Akinobu's perf-event RFC v3 [akinobu-v3] is a useful contrast:
    it stays builtin because it's a generic configurable
    perf_event_attr passthrough, no vendor-specific code in the
    overflow handler.  The tristate case is specifically for the
    backends that need vendor logic outside perf_event_attr
    (IBS dc_phy_addr_valid, future ARM SPE record-format
    handling, future Intel PEBS DLA quirks if they need
    kernel-side filtering beyond what perf delivers).

Bharata, would value your perspective on two related questions: in
your long-term plan for pghot, do you see the legacy IBS Op path
(this RFC) staying as a DAMON-side backend, while the new IBS-MProf
path lands under pghot?  Or do you envision both IBS facilities
eventually feeding through a common HW-sampler primitive (pghot or
DAMON), with frontend selectable by user config?  And on existing
Zen 3+ silicon: is the legacy IBS Op driver in this RFC the right
home for those processors going forward.

Thanks,
Ravi
