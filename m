How so? The kprobe handler is essentially the same. Setting the
whitelisting aside, it is currently possible to do:

echo af_alg_sendmsg > /sys/kernel/debug/fail_function/inject
echo 0xffffffffffffffff > /sys/kernel/debug/fail_function/af_alg_sendmsg/retval
echo 100 > /sys/kernel/debug/fail_function/probability
echo -1 > /sys/kernel/debug/fail_function/times

and that will return -EPERM, taint the kernel, and log the stacktrace on
dmesg on every rejected call.

Agreed, for this to work fail_function would also need to parse boot
params similarly.

Sure but it makes no difference when a kernel is locked at integrity it
will anyway block either solution, this makes no practical difference.

There's very little code that CONFIG_FUNCTION_ERROR_INJECTION brings in
apart from the override_function_with_return trampoline and
lib/error-inject.c which becomes obsolete without the need to whitelist.

Your proposal also depends on FUNCTION_ERROR_INJECTION necessarily.

The only thing that would be missing and not usually compiled in is
CONFIG_FAIL_FUNCTION that just implements the debugfs ops interface
which you are exposing via securityfs instead.

I'm talking specifically about whitelisting which would essentially be
useless:

wc -l lib/error-inject.c include/asm-generic/error-injection.h include/linux/error-injection.h
 246 lib/error-inject.c
  43 include/asm-generic/error-injection.h
  28 include/linux/error-injection.h
 317 total

plus a hundred or so annotations of ALLOW_ERROR_INJECT and a tiny bit of
image space savings from dropping that whitelist section from the binary.

All of that apart from the cmdline parser is already present in the
fault/error injection code, directly or indirectly. I can see though the
appeal of having killswitch cleanly separated from anything else, but
perhaps changing the existing code is more approachable.

Sure, but my point is that if this is acceptable, then it follows that:

- whitelisting becomes irrelevant (even if fail_function remains
  separate), since the exact same capability will be exposed via the
  killswitch interface for all functions anyway, so why would we need it
  to protect error-injection

and subsequently:

- fail_function would become somewhat redundant since the same
  functionality would be achieved via the securityfs (or just bpf, which
  is already the case).

Anthony
