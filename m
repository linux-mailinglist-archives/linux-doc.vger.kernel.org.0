Waking up sleeping tasks is a core part of the fix. Drivers will need to
do so explicitly in their .remove() operation, through a
subsystem-specific wrapper around a cdev helper function.

There has been previous attempts, including a functional patch series,
that didn't get merge due to the sole reason that it duplicated a small
amount of logic also present in debugfs. I'll reply to Danilo somewhere
else in this mail thread with more information.

fully agreed. Follow-up fixes is not the right way forward. As Johan
said, the quick merge despite the open issues, circumventing the normal
review process, damages trust, and reduces my motivation to review your
work and help shaping a good API to solve this problem.
