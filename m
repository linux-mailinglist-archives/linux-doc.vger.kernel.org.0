Perhaps it is worth having the document explicitly talk about middle
grounds between "directly access C apis" and "don't use unsafe code"?
My file abstractions [1] expose an unsafe function called
`assume_no_fdget_pos` and I intend for Rust Binder to have an unsafe
block calling that function. Using such an unsafe API is meaningfully
different from just directly calling `bindings::fget`, but both are
unsafe.

Though it doesn't seem like the document actually says "don't use
unsafe code in drivers". It just says "use abstractions".
