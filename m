Hi Gregory,

Thanks for drawing this up.

The concept of reporting in CEDT is a little vague. Perhaps expand on that a little
with something like:

A device present at boot will be associated with a CFMWS reported in
@doc:`CEDT<acpi/cedt>` and that CFMWS may match the size of the device.

Adding capacity larger than the original device

Relax to 'some platforms'

Just to future proof the doc for when people start mostly doing the sensible thing.

How do switches report this? I don't think they can as it really has nothing
to do with the switch beyond maybe how many DSPs it has (which incidentally
is what is used to work out space for PCI HP where the code divides up space
left over space between HP DSPs.).

Obviously this excludes the weird switches that are out there than pretend
to be a single memory device as those are not switches at all as far
as Linux is concerned.

Same as above. Nothing to do with switches as far as I understand things
beyond them providing fan out. So if you have
       HB0          HB1
    RP0 RP1         RP2
     |   |           | 
   Empty Empty      USP
              _______|_______
             |    |   |     |
            DSP  DSP  DSP   DSP
             |    |   |     |
                All empty

You might provide more room for devices below HB1 than HB0 if you don't expect
to see switches being hot added.
