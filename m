Hi Fabio!

trying to answer these things as best I can!

Notice I'm not natively anglo-saxon either.

It's refreshing to have a discussion about formulations in text
in addition to our everyday technical churn!

I think the following is the best:

"There are also other, common and expected causes of page faults".

No bridge words. I can't really explain it, it's just language intuition. :=

An option is to also move the section about the common case section
before the exceptions, which may be more natural to the flow of the text.

It's because the kernel handles many address spaces and is aware about
also the userspace address space and the physical address space.
So just so emphasize which one it is.
