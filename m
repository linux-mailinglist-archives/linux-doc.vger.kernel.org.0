Thanks for the feedback!

In a similar way to how they would know if a given livepatch is safe to apply -
ideally it would be communicated by the vendor/distro/kernel team.

"On Debian XX.YY, use the following command to mitigate CVE-AAAA-BBBB:

  echo "engage woops -1" > /sys/kernel/security/killswitch/control"

This would definitely help (and in light of how the last couple of weeks played
out, the case for livepatches definitely increased), but not all
vendors/distros provide livepatches.

My personal usecase is simple: I use debian, with their kernel. I'm not going
to get livepatches from debian, and it would take a few days/weeks for a kernel
update to land. I want a simple solution that'll let me disable functionality I
don't care about.

So I can't use livepatching/fault injection/etc easily.
