How about 

One could of course imagine a linear page table with enormous amount of
entries, but that would be really wasteful because large parts of the
virtual address space are empty and such linear table would be extremely
sparse. With hierarchical page tables large holes in the virtual address
space do not waste memory because it is enough to mark them as unmapped at
a higher level of the page table. 

And on modern CPUs, a higher level page table can point directly to physical
memory range, which allows mapping of several megabytes or even gigabytes
by a single high level page table entry.
