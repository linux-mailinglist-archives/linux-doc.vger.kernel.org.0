Hi Dongliang, Weijie,

Thank you both -- this is more support than I expected, and I am glad
to do this together.

To be honest: no, I am not familiar with the maintainer workflow yet --
so far I have only been on the contributor side. So routing zh_TW
patches through Alex's tree first sounds like the right arrangement to
me, both for reliability and so that I can learn the workflow properly
before taking on more. Alex, if you are fine with this, thank you in
advance.

> I suggest that we could try out the provisional plan for about one or
> two months (depends), and then make a formal change.

Agreed. A trial period before touching MAINTAINERS is fair -- it lets
the work speak first. I will send the MAINTAINERS patch when you both
feel the arrangement has proven itself.

This matches what I had in mind, and it also answers Alex's concern:
zh_TW should track zh_CN in structure and coverage, and differ only in
terminology. I will start by running checktransupdate.py over zh_TW to
get a concrete inventory of what is stale and how far behind we are,
and share the result here so we can prioritize together.

> re-translation may be more efficient.

Agreed for the badly outdated files -- patching a two-year-old
translation line by line is likely more work than translating the
current text afresh. The inventory should tell us which files fall
into which category.

As a native speaker: it is a reasonable general reference, but it is
not kernel-specific, and some entries are dated or not what people
actually write in Taiwan today. I would rather build the glossary
bottom-up from the terms that actually appear in the kernel docs
(=E8=BB=9F=E9=AB=94/=E8=BB=9F=E4=BB=B6, =E4=BB=8B=E9=9D=A2/=E6=8E=A5=E5=8F=
=A3, =E8=A8=98=E6=86=B6=E9=AB=94, =E8=A1=8C=E7=A8=8B, =E6=A0=B8=E5=BF=83, =
=E4=BD=87=E5=88=97, ...), and use the
wikibooks table only as a cross-check. I will include the glossary as
part of the first terminology series so it can be reviewed like any
other patch.

That would help a lot, thank you. It also sounds like a natural split:
you on process and monitoring, me on the translation and the zh_TW
terminology judgement.

One last thing about the patch that started all this: rather than
keeping the v2 for 8.Conclusion pending, I would suggest dropping it
and folding its changes into the terminology series, so the fixes
land in one consistent batch. Any objection?

Thanks,
Chen-Yu
