If there is a mechanism to tag all this memory, or regions, into a
specific section, what we would do with it next ?
It would have a purpose to be parsed and reused by different drivers,
that would be able to actually use it.
So there has a to be some kind of middleman, that holds onto this list
of regions, manages it (unique id, add/remove), and allows certain
drivers to use it.
Now it would be interesting to have different kind of drivers connect to
it (or backends how I called them).
One of these programs an internal table for the firmware to use.
Another , writes information into a dedicated reserved-memory for the
bootloader to use on the next soft reboot (memory preserved).
I called this middleman kmemdump. But it can be named differently, and
it can reside in different places in the kernel.
But what I would like to avoid is to just tag all this memory and have
any kind of driver connect to the table. That works, but it's quite
loose on having control over the table. E.g. no kmemdump, tag all the
memory to sections, and have specific drivers (that would reside where?)
walk it.

One idea I had to to have a jtag script read the table , parse it, and
know where some information resides.
Another idea is to use Uboot in case of persistent memory across reboot,
and Uboot can read all the sections and assemble a ready-to-download
coredump. (sure this doesn't work in all cases)
What can be done in case of hypervisor is to implement there a routine
that would read it, in case the OS is non-responsive, or even in the
secure monitor.
Another suggestion I had from someone was to use a pure software default
backend in which to just keep the regions stored, and it could be
accessed through userspace or read by a crash analyzer.
