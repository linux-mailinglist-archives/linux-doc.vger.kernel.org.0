This is an issue irrespective of how the trace sink is turned on, be
it automatically or explicitly.
Given that it is possible to read the sink data without disabling the
sink - the chances are it could happen either way.

Actually all connections can tell you is the number sinks available to
the etm on the path - not which would be selected by the current
priority algorithm - unless the user is willing to dig into the driver
source code and figure out the priority mechanism.
