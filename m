...I would not say that this was the kind of feedback I was hoping for,
but I am NOT gonna argue, given that you shot down already what I thought
were all my best selling points :P

At this point my understanding is that the way forward must be to use
a custom tool to configure/extract/translate the raw Telemetry data and
move up into userspace the whole human readable FS layer via FUSE, if
really needed.

I suppose that the new kernel/user interface has to be some dedicated char
device implementing proper fops. (like I did previously in early versions
of this series and then abandoned...)

Is this you have in mind ? Dedicated character device(s) with enough fops
to be able to configure/extract Telemetry data with a custom tool ?

Should/could such a tool live in the kernel tree (tools/) at least for
ease of development/deployment ?

There were also bulk read-all-together interfaces but it does not matter
at this point...

...well, I am sure Greg would have shot down the SysFS approach even
more quickly, given the amount of abuse I had to carry-on to be able
to fit my Telemetry sources on top of a zillion dummy devices created
just to be representable in SysFS; indeed I did try to use SysFS in the
initial RFC and it was also a lot of pain to play that game in my
context from the implementation point of view...

...so I thought that adopting this new unified FS approach would have
been much cleaner and acceptable upstream... :D

Thanks again,
Cristian
