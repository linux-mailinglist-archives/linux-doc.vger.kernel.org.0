Yeah, I'd tend to agree.

It's not actually RFC now, but "RFT" (request for testing). I don't
_think_ there's any need to send a version without the RFT tag before
landing unless someone really feels strongly about it.


> after the next merge window

With drm-misc there's not really any specific reason to wait for the
merge window to open/close as we can land in drm-misc-next at any time
regardless of the merge window. drm-misc-next will simply stop feeding
linuxnext for a while.

That all being said, I'm happy to delay landing this until after the
next -rc1 comes out if people would prefer that. If I don't hear
anything, I guess I'll just wait until -rc1 before landing any of
these.


> and see what happens. I doubt it
> will cause much trouble.

I can land the whole series if that's what everyone agrees on. As I
mentioned above, I'm at least slightly worried that I did something
stupid _somewhere_ in this series since no automation was possible and
with repetitive tasks like this it's super easy to flub something up.
It's _probably_ fine, but I guess I still have the worry in the back
of my mind.

If folks think I should just apply the whole series then I'm happy to
do that. If folks think I should just land parts of the series as they
are reviewed/tested I can do that as well. Let me know. If I don't
hear anything I'd tend to just land patches that are reviewed/tested.
Then after a month or so (hopefully) I'd send out a v2 with anything
left.
