Hi Mauro,

it is not comfortable but is it mad? ..

Most often languages (or applications) do not handle encoding
of strings they just piping a binary stream while python
decode / encodes strings.

"The Zen of Python" [1] says

    Explicit is better than implicit.

If a stream can't encode symbols and these symbols should be ignored
you have to set the encoding of the stream explicit to ignore
such symbols.

I guess this encode discussions will haunt me for the rest of my
life.  My escape strategy is to use UTF-8 wherever possible.
