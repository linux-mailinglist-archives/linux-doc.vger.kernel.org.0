OK, thanks for clarifying.

OK, good.  Getting the rounding behaviour right so that the MPAM
conversion is stable turned out to be a subtle business, so it's
reassuring that if we find it isn't implemented quite right and need to
fine-tune it later, we don't consider that an interface break (within
reason).

Ack.  It's a joint responsbility.

Thinking about it, I don't think that the value returned by
resctrl_arch_preconvert_bw() is used in any way except for storing it
into rdt_ctrl_domain::staged_configs[] for later consumption by
resctrl_arch_update_domains().

If so, the meaning of this value is really arch-determined.

It is convenient for the x86 implementation to convert this to hardware
form at parse time, whereas, because of the way the MPAM code is
structured, it suits the MPAM driver better to convert it later on.

In the x86 case, it means that the arch code doesn't have to
distinguish much between input values for different kinds of control:
it's just a matter of writing precomputed values to MSRs.  This keeps
parts of the backend simple.

In the MPAM case, it's more about encapsulating grungy arch-specific
details in the driver.  The common resctrl structures don't contain all
the information needed.  We might have to pull a lot of junk out of the
private headers in order to the conversion in the context of an inline
function called by the schemata parser.

I think that it's likely that either all the conversion work is done in
resctrl_arch_preconvert_bw() (e.g., x86), or all the work is done in
the resctrl_arch_update_domains() backend (e.g., MPAM).  There's
probably no good reason ever to split the work into two parts.

Does that make sense?

Cheap shot, I know.

I guess that more is known now about what kinds of control behaviour
are likely to exist than was known about when resctrl was first
developed... though we still don't have a crystal ball.

My aim is generalise enough to cover most of what we know about today,
while not inventing pie-in-the-sky abstractions that may never be
fully used...  It's a balancing act, though.

There's a fine like between a "random nonportable junk" schema and
reasonable exposure of an architecture-specific control that makes
sense within resctrl but is unlikely to map onto other architectures.

We should certainly push back on the latter, but could it be appropriate
to expose arch-specific control types in some situations?  I don't like
to rule it out absolutely.

Cheers
