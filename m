I'm trying not to focus that much on the negative dentries since it has
no relevance for fuse, but was just a nice effect to solve that one, too,
and a bit of 'when you're at it' logic.
I'm more interested in throwing out the unused ones.

You are completely right in your analysis that this could remove fresh
and useful negative dentries.

correct

As I mentioned in the other post, I kinda did this (not triggered by user
space, though, just by a limit negotiated during init with user space) 
just for fuse and was told that this kind of limit would be useful in vfs.

This would be a cool idea.

probably ... 
I still think that a lock held is a good indicator that we can just move on.

Thanks for your time,
