[Dropped irrelevant CCs]

Hi Bagas,

First of all, can I ask you to refrain from submitting new versions
everyday?  It is one of the most frowned-upon behavior in the kernel
community.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.ht=
ml#don-t-get-discouraged-or-impatient

I'm intentionally ignoring v4.

I'm afraid I'm not convinced.

Let's see the history of this document.

It first appeared in commit 17defc282fe6 ("Documentation: add
meta-documentation for Sphinx and kernel-doc") as a chapter among
other topics which evolved into current Documentation/doc-guide/.
Back then there was a proper document title of "Linux Kernel
Documentation".

It was renamed "How to write kernel documentation" in commit
555af62431e6 ("docs: retitle the kernel-documentation.rst"), which
you still find in Documentation/doc-guide/index.rst.

It got split by commit 1dc4bbf0b268 ("docs-rst: doc-guide:
split the kernel-documentation.rst contents") in 2016.
The title markers have not been touched ever since.

This is why you find those markers one level below the ones
suggested in the guideline.

I think the guideline predates the reorganization of
Documentations/ into document-wise subdirectories.
It needs some expansion regarding .rst docs included from
index.rst files under subdirectories.

What does "document title" mean?  The one in index.rst?

What happens when a .rst file has a "document title"-level
title at the beginning?  Would it be treated as a "chapter"
level title?

What happens when an index.rst file is included from
another index.rst file?

Which title is used as a "page title" in the HTML docs?

=2E.. and so on.

I'd like to suggest you do the expansion of the guideline
itself, which will be much appreciated.

        Thanks, Akira
