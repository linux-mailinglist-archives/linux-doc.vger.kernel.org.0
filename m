Because the RISC-V people only want to merge code for "frozen" or 
"ratified" processor extensions, and the RISC-V foundation is dragging 
their feet in ratifying the hypervisor extension.

It's totally a self-inflicted pain on part of the RISC-V maintainers; 
see Documentation/riscv/patch-acceptance.rst:

   We'll only accept patches for new modules or extensions if the
   specifications for those modules or extensions are listed as being
   "Frozen" or "Ratified" by the RISC-V Foundation.  (Developers may, of
   course, maintain their own Linux kernel trees that contain code for
   any draft extensions that they wish.)

I agree wholeheartedly.

I have heard contrasting opinions on conflict of interest where the 
employers of the maintainers benefit from slowing down the integration 
of code in Linus's tree.  I find these allegations believable, but even 
if that weren't the case, the policy is (to put it kindly) showing its 
limits.

It is my problem because I am trying to help Anup merging some perfectly 
good KVM code; when a new KVM port comes up, I coordinate merging the 
first arch/*/kvm bits with the arch/ maintainers and from that point on 
that directory becomes "mine" (or my submaintainers').
