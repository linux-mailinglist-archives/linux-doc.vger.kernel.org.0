Hmm, I'm afraid I don't think it has ever did.

In the discussion of the PR, you commented on 15 Oct 2020 at
https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/pull/8313#issuecomment-708977457:

So you might have thought that the issue was already resolved.

Later on in the discussion, @jakobandersen reported the status of
the PR on 2 Apr 2021 at:
https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/pull/8313#issuecomment-812408069.

If I understand the complex comment correctly, there is another PR at
https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/pull/8929 as a prerequisite
to PR 8313.

PR 8929 now belongs to the 5.x milestone (missed 5.0.0). PR 8313 has never
had a milestone assigned.  So it looks to me like things are progressing
very slowly and we need to wait another release or two at least.

Of course, all of this is just my interpretation without knowing any
of Sphinx development and might be wrong in many aspects.

        Thanks, Akira
