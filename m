How is an EFI stub image's header different in grub than somewhere else?

No, the LoongArch EFI boot protocol is not the same as that of RISC-V, 
we've taken lessons and I believe the LoongArch GRUB2 simply chain-loads 
the image without any of the extra Linux-specific checking. Please read 
the previous EFI boot patch threads carefully, and you can also ask 
Xiaotian or Huacai for details (they're both CC'd on this thread so they 
should have the context).

Since the boot image is just a PE file, and it's clearly mandated in the 
UEFI spec, I think some knowledge of the PE format should be necessary 
after all? In which case the reader could be pointed to the PE spec for 
the parts not related to Linux or LoongArch, and this document can stay 
focused on its main topic.
