Unfortunately it is possible and has happened that the same primecell
regs for a CTI connected to a v8 core and one that is used as a
general system CTI appear in the same system.
There is no architectural requirement on the CTI to indicate that its
external connections are as per v8 architecture spec when connected to
 a PE/ETM combo.

Therefore a compatible "arm,coresight-cti-v8" would seem the best
route. I'll update the compatible portion of the schema and handling
code accordingly.
