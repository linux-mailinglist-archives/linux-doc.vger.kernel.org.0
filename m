I realised this didn't have a cc to linux-mm.

For that matter, linux-doc might have some opinions.

I have a substantial question, and then some formatting / appearance
questions.

The first is, what does mlock_count represent for a multi-page folio
that is partially mlocked?  If you allocate an order-9 page then mmap()
13 pages of it and mlockall(), does mlock_count increase by 1, 13 or 512?

Then we have a tradeoff between prettiness of the source code and
prettiness of the htmldocs.  At one maximum, we can make it look like
this in the htmldocs:

struct folio {
  unsigned long flags;
  struct list_head lru;
  unsigned int mlock_count;
  struct address_space *mapping;
  pgoff_t index;
  void *private;
  atomic_t _mapcount;
  atomic_t _refcount;
#ifdef CONFIG_MEMCG;
  unsigned long memcg_data;
#endif;
};

but at the cost of making the source code look like this:

struct folio {
        /* private: don't document the anon union */
        union {
                struct {
        /* public: */
                        unsigned long flags;
        /* private: */
                        union {
        /* public: */
                                struct list_head lru;
        /* private: */
                                struct {
                                        void *__filler;
        /* public: */
                                        unsigned int mlock_count;
        /* private: */
                                };
                        };
        /* public: */
                        struct address_space *mapping;

At the other extreme, the htmldocs can look more complicated:

struct folio {
  unsigned long flags;
  union {
    struct list_head lru;
    struct {
      unsigned int mlock_count;
    };
  };
  struct address_space *mapping;
  pgoff_t index;
  void *private;
  atomic_t _mapcount;
  atomic_t _refcount;
#ifdef CONFIG_MEMCG;
  unsigned long memcg_data;
#endif;
};

with the source code changes being merely:

                        };

Various steps in between are possible, such as removing the anonymous
struct from the documentation, but leaving the union.  We could also
choose to document __filler, but that seems like a poor choice to me.

Anyway, that's all arguable and not really too important.  My mild
preference is for the private/public markers around __filler alone,
but I'll happily abide by the preferences of others.

The important part is what mlock_count really means.  We can be
reasonably verbose here (two or three lines of text, I'd suggest).
