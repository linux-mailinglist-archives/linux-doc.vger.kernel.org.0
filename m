I'll keep you posted as it goes. I think with the work that you've
already put in, it wouldn't require that much more.

It's not that there's anything blocking pKVM from doing that. It's
that the disconnect of using a memory address for the shared memory,
and a file descriptor for the private memory doesn't really make sense
for pKVM. I see how it makes sense for TDX and the Intel-specific
implementation. It just seems that this is baking in an
implementation-specific aspect as a part of the KVM general api, and
the worry is that this might have some unintended consequences in the
future.

Right. I was expecting them to be in the mem_fd, but I see now how
they are being set and enforced in patch 13. This makes a lot of sense
now. Thanks!

Of course! We'll continue this online, and hopefully we will get a
