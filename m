The goal sought by that early document precisely is to draw the line
between what is a regular bug and hwat is a kernel bug. The kernel
currently doesn't consider problems posed by a crafted USB device as a
security issue because the kernel trusts the hardware in runs on. Of
course there can be valid reasons to disagree with this, but it's just
the current situation and the purpose of the document is to clarify it
so that bugs are reported to the right place and handled efficiently.

Possibly that such ones might appear there at some point. The best
way for these might be to have such teams try to step up as
co-maintainers for the parts they care about though.

Trust me, patches written behind closed doors rarely resist publication
and discovery by the maintainer. And treating bugs as regular ones in
fact tends to make them move faster than as security ones. No need to
go back-and-forth asking for data that reporters hesitate to share, nor
to have to first convince them that their bug needs to be fixed even
though they were planning on speaking about them at a conference, etc.

Cheers,
Willy
