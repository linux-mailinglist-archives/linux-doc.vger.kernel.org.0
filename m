Perhaps we should have some tests (maybe with kunit?) that can catch
this? If you change the format, the test fails. So you'd have to go and
update the test, and at that point it should be more obvious that ABI
version needs bumping.

I think the right time to do the compatibility check is _before_ kexec.
That is the only point where you can safely abort. Once you boot into
the new kernel and discover you can't understand the passed data, you
are in a bad spot already and should reboot. I don't think think you
really can gracefully handle these failures.

For example, say you fail to understand the incoming PCI data. So you
have no idea which devices are participating in live update and cannot
correctly probe any of them. Which effectively means you cannot resume
any of your guests since you have no idea how to restore their device
state. The only path you are left with is to reboot. I haven't read the
IOMMU series, but I imagine the same story applies there.

For a more benign example, let's assume one of your memfds that back VM
memory fail to restore.

In this case, you can safely leak that memory and run the other guests,
but at that point the host is in impaired state. You don't want to keep
running it in this state. You likely either do a reboot, or if you feel
more adventurous, you do another live update.

In either case, there is no "safely abort" after the kexec happens.

So I think our energy is better spent solving the versioning story
_before_ kexec. After kexec I think it is perfectly fine to error out
and panic or expect a reboot. You can't salvage much at that point
anyway.

And I think how the versioning format looks also should be based on the
design of this pre-kexec check, not the other way round.

I agree. Even if we don't use FDT, something more structured than
composite strings would be nice to have.

There is another nice thing about numbers that Logan (+cc) recently
pointed out. You can tell which one is bigger.

At some point I think we will support multiple versions of a data
structure to allow for upgrades. At that point, it will help to know
which one is "newer". So if both kernel versions support version 3 and
4, you can use 4 to serialize.

This of course is harder to do with strings.
