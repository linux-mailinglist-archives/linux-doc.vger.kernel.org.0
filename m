Not in my opinion. Batching rmap makes sense even without this change, 
and this change makes sense even without batching.

Okay, so your speculation right now is:

1) The change in cacheline might be problematic.

2) The additional atomic operation might be problematic.

I can certainly try getting some numbers on that. If you're aware of 
other micro-benchmarks that would likely notice slower pte-mapping of 
THPs, please let me know.

I think your math is correct.

prep_compound_head() is called after prep_compound_tail(), so 
prep_compound_head() wins.

In __split_huge_page_tail() there is a VM_BUG_ON_PAGE() that explains 
the situation:

/* ->mapping in first and second tail page is replaced by other uses */
VM_BUG_ON_PAGE(tail > 2 && page_tail->mapping != TAIL_MAPPING,
	       page_tail);

Thanks for raising that, I had to look into that myself.
