In general, that's true. However I have first bumped into this can of worms
at work when a client's custom device using a USB-to-I2C adapter and creating
devices dynamically from user-space would crash the kernel or freeze a thread
when the device would be disconnected with processes still referencing file
descriptors. It may not be common but I hope we do care about corner-cases
too.

So I'd say: it's fine as is until it isn't. :)

For sure. I've been trying to address it exclusively in subsystem code, where
this kind of logic belongs. After all, subsystem code is where we do complex
things to make drivers simpler. One exception is I2C where the logic is so
broken we need to first rework a lot of drivers. Wolfram is on board with that
though.

Rust makes it very clear who owns what. That's something that we struggle
a lot with in C, where we have drivers that create objects and then pass
them on to the subsystem for management but the latter still references
objects that are destroyed when the driver is unbound. Devres when used
right is great and the lifetime is very clear: from binding to unbinding.
The using right is the hard part though. :)
