What if we add a reclaim flag that says "hey, we are hitting actual
memory limit and need to make memory reclaim forward progress".

Then, we can have zswap skip compressed cxl backend and fall back to
real compression.

(Maybe also demotion, which only move memory from one node to another,
as well as the new cram.c stuff? This will technically also save some
wasted work, as in the status quo we will need to do a demotion pass
first, before having to reclaiom memory from the bottom tier anyway?
But not sure if we want this).

Yeah this one is no big deal. I like a new informative counter :)
