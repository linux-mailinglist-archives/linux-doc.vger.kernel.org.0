You should try and model this similar to how we manage the debug
breakpoints/watchpoints. In that case the debug register context is
loaded if either:

 (1) Self-hosted debug is actively in use by the guest, or

 (2) The guest has accessed a debug register since the last vcpu_load()

One of the other things that I'd like to see is if we can pare down the
amount of CPU feature dependencies for a partitioned PMU. Annoyingly,
there aren't a lot of machines out there with FEAT_FGT yet, and you
should be able to make all of this work in VHE + FEAT_PMUv3p1.

That "just" comes at the cost of extra traps (leaving TPM and
potentially TPMCR set). You can mitigate the cost of this by emulating
accesses in the fast path that don't need to go out to a kernel context
to be serviced. Same goes for requiring FEAT_HPMN0 to expose 0 event
counters, we can fall back to TPM traps if needed.

Taking perf out of the picture should still give you a significant
reduction vPMU overheads.

Last thing, let's table guest support for FEAT_PMUv3_ICNTR for the time
being. Yes, it falls in the KVM-owned range, but we can just handle it
with a fine-grained undef for now. Once the core infrastructure has
landed upstream we can start layering new features into the partitioned
implementation.

Thanks,
Oliver
