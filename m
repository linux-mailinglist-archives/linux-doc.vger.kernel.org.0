Honestly, we will never get that sort of annotation into the source
without encountering substantial pushback, and it will also be hard to
keep them up to date.  I don't see that as being the right path forward.

The better solution, for now, would be to just insist that the kerneldoc
comments be next to the thing they are describing, and to submit patches
fixing these issues to the appropriate maintainers.  Mauro and others
have been doing a fair amount of that already.

It might also be nice to make scripts/kernel-doc smarter so that it can
handle any degree of separation between the comment and the
declaration.  But that would complicate an already gnarly script for
(IMO) relatively little gain.

Thanks,

jon
