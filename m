I completely agree with this approach. I don't think anyone really
advocates for considering that causing an oops from userspace is a
normal behaviour. While the various discussions on this topic that
escalated into heated arguments over time may have created an impression
that we have two camps, I think we are all fundamentally in the same
camp: we want to kernel to run reliably without crashing, with
performant technical solutions. And let's remember that we achieve this
goal best when we work together.

One a side note, devm_request_irq() is another of the devm_* helpers
that cause race conditions, as interrupt handlers can run right after
.remove() returns, which drivers will most likely not handle correctly.

That's what I've been advocating for. The best way to ensure that driver
code will not accessed data freed at .remove() time is to prevent the
code to run at all.

We have different classes of problems. It's tempting to think that a
single solution can handle them all, but that's often not the best
option. Based on what I've seen so far, handling the fops vs. .remove()
race is best done by ensuring that fops do not race with .remove(). Dan
Williams showed that it can be done quite simply. Conceptually speaking
(not using (S)RCU or other specific kernel primitives, to try and
describe the concepts clearly), it works as follows.

1. At the beginning of .remove(), flag that the device is being removed.

2. At the entry point of all fops, check the flag and return with an
   error if set. This prevents *new* fops from being entered once
   .remove() has started.

3. At the entry point of all fops, flag that a fop is in progress (with
   a counter).

4. In .remove(), wake up all threads sleeping in fops.

5. At the exit point of all fops, decrease the fop-in-progress counter.

6. In .remove(), wait until the fop-in-progress counter reaches 0. At
   that point, it is guaranteed that all fops will have completed and
   that no new fop can run.

7. Complete .remove(), freeing resources.

Most of this of course would need to be handled in helpers at the cdev
level, and wrapped in subsystem helpers. Drivers will need to be
modified to

- Call a helper at the beginning of .remove() to handle (1).

- Wake up threads sleeping in fops (3), as only drivers know about these
  (in the general case, in some subsystems this may be handled in
  helpers).

- Call a helper to handle (6).

The only fop that this doesn't handle is .release(), as we can't block
.remove() until userspace closes all open file descriptors and unmaps
all memory. This is also the race condition that is the easiest to
trigger (along with the race conditions related to threads sleeping in
fops).

Solving the .release() race also requires driver involvement too. By
definition drivers have tasks to perform in .release() that need to
access resources (MMIO, data structures, ...) - otherwise there would be
no .release() operation. Drivers need to synchronize between .remove()
and .release() and skip release tasks that have been performed by
.remove() already. Strategy depends on subsystems, in the V4L2 case
things can be more complex as it's common for drivers to create multiple
cdevs, but it's entirely maangeable with clear concepts that can be
documented, implemented, and checked during review.

Drivers using resources provided by other drivers is a more complex
problem. I'm thinking about a driver acquiring a GPIO in .probe(), and
the GPIO provider disappearing at a random point of time. Or a clock, or
a regulator. These issues are more rare if we ignore unbinding drivers
forcefully through sysfs, but they can still occur, so we should try to
find a solution here too (and the sysfs unbind issue is also worth
fixing). There, unlike in the cdev case, some sort of revocable API
could make sense.
