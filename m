Agreed. Actually, if we had HW descriptions for every feature in FWFT,
and allowed each feature to have implementation-defined reset values,
then we wouldn't need the get function. The OS would only call the
set function if it disagreed with the value it saw in the HW description.
But this is getting off-topic and we can just agree that FWFT isn't the
right approach.

Actually, I don't know. Maybe Palmer can point to something.
