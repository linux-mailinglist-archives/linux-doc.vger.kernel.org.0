The problem is this part never happened. Loggers are supposed to tell
you about the error in your application, not crash it.

But the problem with Sphinx may be that the output file is also assumed
to be in the locale encoding, and the output encoding is never set. It's
HTML so it could be encoded with entities, too.

The idea about handlinng encoding precisely is not mad in itself but then
everybody working with just ASCII and never testing their software works
in the cases where explicit handling is needed is the mad part. Too
US-centric culture for getting encodings right I guess.

Thanks
