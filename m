True, but we have a script that tracks those problems and even
auto-correct most of such broken references.

Right now, there are *lots* of references to a /Documentation.*
file, without any sphinx tags:


	$ git grep Documentation/ Documentation/|grep -v ':doc:`'|grep -v ABI|grep -v binding|wc -l
	1515

An extension like Documentation/sphinx/automarkup.py could
easily replace them by :doc:`Documentation/foo`, creating
links on all those places at no cost.

Adding explicit :ref: would require manual work, and I bet some
maintainers will reject adding extra markups on some files.

As currently we don't use intersphinx, I'm not too much concerned
about what it could provide in the future.

In any case, maybe one day intersphinx will have support for :doc: 
types added there as well. 

Without looking into the dirty details, it doesn't sound too hard to add 
support for it: intersphinx could simply create a :ref: type of reference 
for all files (like, __doc_driver_api__media__drivers__tuners). Then,
any place with a :doc:`/driver-api/media/drivers/tuner` would be
dynamically replaced by a :ref:`__doc_driver_api__media__drivers__tuners`
at runtime.

Maybe. I tried several times on some documents, but it caused sphinx
warnings about unknown cross references. Not sure why, and didn't
investigated it further.

The thing with PDF is that not many developers (I know) are using it.

Maybe now that we have a separate directory with just the PDF books,
without the other temporary files people may start using it more.

Well, I also often prefer reading a PDF book, when it provides a good
comprehensive documentation. On most places, we're not there yet: there 
are too many gaps inside the documentation for it to be used as a real
book. I hope someday this will change.

Thanks,
Mauro
