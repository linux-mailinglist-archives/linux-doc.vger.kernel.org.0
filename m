Not an issue before large folios, am I right?  Because having a head page
reused as tail cannot happen iiuc with current thps if only pmd-sized,
because the head page is guaranteed to be pmd aligned physically.

I don't really know, where a hugetlb 2M head can be reused by a 1G huge
later right during the window of fast-gup walking. But obviously that's not
common either if that could ever happen.

Maybe Matthew was referring to something else (per "in many places")?

Thanks,
