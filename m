Agreed. We're not dropping support for CPUs that don't give us what we'd
like here, we're just not bending over to port and maintain new
optimisations for them. I think that's a reasonable compromise?

That said, thanks for raising this, Jonathan. It's a useful data point
to know that TLB conflict aborts exist in the wild!
