I am not sure if I understand you correctly. I think what you're proposing is:

- Page tables either point directly to a swap slot, or to a virtual swap entry.
- By default, page tables just point to swap slots maintaining current behavior.
- If we have multiple backends (e.g. zswap or tiering), we use virtual
swap entry instead.
- The physical swapfile has clusters and swap tables (status quo).
- Virtual swap is implemented with clusters and swap tables in a
virtual space, and each table entry points to an underlying swap slot
or zswap entry.
- If a page table has a physical swap slot, and we need to do tiering,
we basically "make it virtual" by making the swap table of the
physical swapfile point at a virtual swap entry? or another physical
swapfile? Not sure.

In this design we have swap tables in both the virtual swap space as
well as the physical swapfile, right? How does this work? Where does
the metadata/swapcache live?

I am not sure if I got it right, I am a bit confused.

Why >16 bytes? Do we need anything extra other than the reverse

I don't think I quite understand it yet, maybe I am the problem :)

Interesting.
