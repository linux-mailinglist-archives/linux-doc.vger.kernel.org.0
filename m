For example, customers can be given options for which kind of protection they
want to choose for their workloads based on factors like data protection
requirement, cost, speed, etc.

In terms of features SEV-ES is superset of SEV but that doesn't mean SEV
ASIDs are superset of SEV ASIDs. SEV ASIDs cannot be used for SEV-ES VMs
and similarly SEV-ES ASIDs cannot be used for SEV VMs. Once a system is
booted, based on the BIOS settings each type will have their own
capacity and that number cannot be changed until the next boot and BIOS
changes.

We are not mixing the two types of ASIDs, they are separate and used
separately.

My first patch was only for SEV, but soon we got comments that this can
be abstracted and used by TDX and SEID for their use cases.

I see this patch as providing an abstraction for simple accounting of
resources used for creating secure execution contexts. Here, secure
execution is achieved through different means. SEID, TDX, and SEV
provide security using different features and capabilities. I am not
sure if we will reach a point where all three and other vendors will use
the same approach and technology for this purpose.

Instead of each one coming up with their own resource tracking for their
features, this patch is providing a common framework and cgroup for
tracking these resources.

I think we should see these as features provided on a host. Tasks can
be executed securely on a host with the guarantees provided by the
specific feature (SEV, SEV-ES, TDX, SEID) used by the task.

I don't think each H/W vendor can agree to a common set of security
guarantees and approach.

Sorry, I don't understand this approach. Can you please give more
details about it?

Thanks
