I'm here to do a comparison of some choices briefly to let the maintainer understand the issues and the solutions. I think it's time to make a decision before the next Linux LTS v6.9. As a number of sv48 chips will be released this year.

Is this the same regression as before?  IIUC the real issue there is 
that userspace wasn't passing MAP_FIXED and expecting a fixed address to 
be mapped.  That's just a bug in userspace.

Is there any software that uses mmap() in a legal way that the flags 
patch caused a regression in?  If that's the case then we'll need to 
figure out what it's doing so we can avoid the regression.

The only thing I can think of are realloc-type schemes, where rounding 
the hint address down would result in performance problems.  I don't 
know of anything like that specifically, but I think Charlie's patch 
would fix it.

IIUC arm64/amd64 started with 48-bit-capable hardware and kernels, and 
thus the only regression was when moving to the larger VA spaces.  We 
started with sv39-based VA space,

The OpenJDK and Go people have at least talked about using the interface 
as it is currently defined.  I'm trying to chase down some of the folks 
around here who understand that stuff, but it might take a bit...

IMO we can call that compatible with the docs.  There's sort of a grey 
area in "A hint address passed to mmap will cause the largest
address space that fits entirely into the hint to be used" as to how 
that hint address is used, but I think interpreting it as the base 
address is sane and we can just update the docs.

This also should fix the realloc-type cases I can think of, though those 
are sort of theoretical right now.

I'm not quite sure what you're trying to say there.  If users are 
passing a hint that's already allocated then they're not going to get 
that address allocated, so as long as we give them something else we're 
OK.

We might want to take more advantage of the clause in the docs that 
allows larger addresses to be allocated under memory pressure to avoid 
too many allocation failures, but that applies to any of these schemes.
