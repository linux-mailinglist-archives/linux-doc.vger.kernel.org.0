Wow, thank you very much for this great explanation (without a
reproducer) - it's nice to hear somebody that deeply understands the
code! And double thanks for CCing Bjorn.

So, I don't want to hijack Liu's thread, but do you think it makes
sense to have my approach as a (debug) parameter to prevent such a
degenerate case? Or could we have something in core IRQ code to
prevent irq flooding in such scenarios, something "stronger" than
disabling MSIs (APIC-level, likely)?

Cheers,


Guilherme
