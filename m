This does not make sense however you look at it. Using | between logical
expressions ...
It sounds like it is some pseudocode in no language in particular so
it's hard to tell what it actually means and the document does not have
enough context to be able to tell. I suppose there is some comment
somewhere in the kernel code that would clarify this - at least what the
bit patterns mean.
