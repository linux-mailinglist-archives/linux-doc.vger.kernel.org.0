Ah, I see.  Sorry for the noise.

I did mess the indent level here.

The "'" at the end should be a "`", so that the end result should look:

:ref:`7.	ANALOGY WITH REFERENCE COUNTING <7_whatisRCU>`

Do you see what I mean?  Otherwise, I'll send a fixup patch later
in the morning here.

        Thanks, Akira
