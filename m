Dear friend .

I know that this mail will come to you as a surprise. I am a
practitioner at law to a deceased Immigrant property Magnate. I hoped
that you will not expose or betray this trust and confident that I am
about to repose on you for the mutual benefit of our both families.

I need your urgent assistance in transferring the sum ofUS$11.5million
immediately to your account. The money has been dormant for years in
our bank here without anybody coming for it. We want to release the
money to you as the nearest person to our deceased customer the owner
of the account who died along with his supposed next of kin. I don't
want the money to go into our bank treasury as an abandoned fund.
 So this is the reason why I contacted you, so that we can release the
money to you as the nearest person to the deceased customer. Please we
would like you to keep this proposal as a top Secret and delete if you
are not interested.

Upon receipt of your reply, I will send you full details on how the
business will be executed and also note that you will have 50% of the
above mentioned sum if you agree to transact the business with us. I
await your urgent response as soon as possible.

This is the information that I will need from you.

FULL NAMES/ADDRESS.....................
AGE AND SEX.................
