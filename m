Seeing no response from anyone so far, I feel like I need to express
my personal view. As you might already be well aware of, I love the
site navigation of RTD both on large screens and small (narrow) screens.

On *what* should be in the sidebar, I don't see anything missing
give or take the toctree depth.

To my eyes, there is two deficiencies with the alabaster theme in site
navigation.

  - Even with this RFC patch amended with the diff I suggested in
    https://lore.kernel.org/linux-doc/6b2e496f-d7f6-abea-6bbd-4b12fea76a68@gmail.com/,
    there remain "Where am I???" moments when jumping to a different page.
    In such jumps, alabaster's sidebar always reset to top with the
    main pane. RTD's sidebar keeps its position so there is no such
    moment.

  - On small/narrow screens, alabaster's sidebar is pushed downward
    to the bottom of the page. This means you typically need three
    steps to see where you are when jumping to another page:

      1) Jump to another page.
      2) Scroll to the bottom.
      3) See where you are.

    With RTD, you don't need to scroll to the bottom. Sidebar is there
    behind an icon at the top-left which is often used as "menu" icon.

      1) Jump to another page.
      2) Open sidebar and it tells you where you are.

I don't know if alabaster can be managed to behave similar to RTD
with a reasonable effort.

        Thanks, Akira
