We'd need to coordinate with kernel.org's automated build of the
documentation.  I believe Konstantin handles that.  With pip, I imagine
he can install whatever version is needed.

There's a bug I've been meaning to track down & report where _some_ links
are broken when building with the Sphinx natively installed on my system
(Debian 4.3.2-1).  I haven't bothered because (a) life is short and (b)
it's not affecting the kernel.org build.  If we're going to ask
kernel.org to move to a newer version of Sphinx, we should make sure
that the links won't be broken on whatever version we pick.

An example:
<span class="kt"><span class="pre">void</span></span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p"><span class="pre">*</span></span><span class="sig-name descname"><span class="n"><span class="pre">kmap_local_folio</span></span></span><span class="sig-paren">(</span><span class="k"><span class="pre">struct</span></span><span class="w"> </span><a class="reference internal" href="#c.kmap_local_folio" title="folio"><span class="n"><span class="pre">folio</span></span></a><span class="w"> </span><span class="p"><span class="pre">*</span></span><span class="n"><span class="pre">folio</span></span>, <span class="n"><span class="pre">size_t</span></span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n"><span class="pre">offset</span></span><span class="sig-paren">)</span><a class="headerlink" href="#c.kmap_local_folio" title="Permalink to this definition">¶</a><br /></dt>

Other than that being a big pile of html, that <a href> around 'folio'
should be a link to struct folio and not back to the c.kmap_local_folio
anchor.

I appreciate this is not a great bug report, but I find the entire
build system beyond my comprehension.
