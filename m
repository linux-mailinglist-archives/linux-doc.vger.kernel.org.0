I have been known to move a few of macros such as this one.
OTOH, if you can coax kernel-doc to skip macros and find a
struct/union/function, that would be OK IMO.

I.e., there is no kernel-doc description there at all.

Then in lib/xz/xz_dec_stream.c, the struct is defined with no
kernel-doc at all.

IMO the struct in lib/xz/xz_dec_stream.c should be marked as
kernel-doc and then all of the fields in it marked as
  /* private: */
since the author(s) seem to want this struct to be private/opaque.

kernel-doc should just ignore/skip/drop __maybe_unused.
