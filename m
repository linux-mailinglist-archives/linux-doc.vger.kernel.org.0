Yes, this is the intent. Looking back at my implementation, I see the
mismatch:

1. **Numerator**: Should count only scheme-eligible bytes.

2. **Denominator**: Should use node capacity, but I used total system
   memory.

You're right. The implementation diverged from what we discussed. I'll
fix both the numerator and denominator in v2.

While implementing, I was thinking about how the metric would behave
in a
system-wide context across multiple nodes and ended up using total
system
memory as the denominator, thinking it would simplify distribution
calculations. However, as you pointed out, using node capacity as the
denominator is the right approach. I'll fix this in v2.

Agreed.

Right, that example was misleading. With node capacity as denominator,
"current_bp =3D 10000" would mean "100% of the node's capacity is
scheme-eligible pages" which would be a valid state.

Yes, As we discussed offline, for a two-context approach:

      Context 0: monitors node 0, migrate_hot =E2=86=92 node 1
        goal: damos_target_mem_node_sys_bp, nid=3D1, target=3D4000
        "Stop when node 1 is 40% hot"

      Context 1: monitors node 1, migrate_hot =E2=86=92 node 0
        goal: damos_target_mem_node_sys_bp, nid=3D0, target=3D6000
        "Stop when node 0 is 60% hot"

Each context eventually stops when its target node reaches the desired
threshold,
and the reverse direction is handled by the other context. For my use
case, eventual convergence with this setup could be acceptable.
An immediate-stop feature could still be useful for the broader community.
Will test and post results after the next iteration.

Agreed. I'll remove the get_goal_metric() ops callback in v2
