Sorry, that was our intention, but had a scripting error. It's been fixed.

I have a script to use with git send-email's --to-cmd and --cc-cmd
option. It uses get_maintainers.pl to figure out who to email, but it
gets trickier for a patch series that spans maintainer trees.

v2 and later will have everyone get all the patches.

The only 2 pieces of information shared between host/guest are:

1. Host CPU frequency -- this isn't really scheduler internals and
will map nicely to a virtual cpufreq driver.

2. A vCPU util value between 0 - 1024 where 1024 corresponds to the
highest performance point across all CPUs (taking freq, arch, etc into
consideration). Yes, this currently matches how the run queue util is
tracked, but we can document the interface as "percentage of max
performance capability", but representing it as 0 - 1024 instead of
0-100. That way, even if the scheduler changes how it tracks util in
the future, we can still keep this interface between guest/host and
map it appropriately on the host end.

In either case, we could even have a Windows guest where they might
track vCPU utilization differently and still have this work with the
Linux host with this interface.

Does that sound reasonable to you?

Another option is to convert (2) into a "CPU frequency" request (but
without latching it to values in the CPUfreq table) but it'll add some
unnecessary math (with division) on the guest and host end. But I'd
rather keep it as 0-1024 unless you really want this 2nd option.
