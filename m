Ok thanks a lot Mauro! It looks much better to me now. I can probably send
this one out too to Paul after the RCU ones are in, after some more careful
review..

However, I am curious what Paul and Alan think about it since some folks such
as PeterZ actively deal with memory model stuff and probably refer a lot to
this document, but don't like ReST (unlike us) and prefer plain text editors
without any markup. Hopefully this is not the case any more..

thanks,

 - Joel
