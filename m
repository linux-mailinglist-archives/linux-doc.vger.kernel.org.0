So I think this is generally OK, if just a bit heavy-handed with the
markup.  One thing right at the beginning catches my eye, though:

This change suggests that the document is current as of last week.
Unless you've made sure that it actually matches the current state of the
kobject code in the v5.6-rc kernels, it's probably better to leave that
date untouched as a warning to others.  Things are relatively static in
kobject land, but I still suspect there might just be a change or two
over the last twelve years...?

Thanks,

jon
