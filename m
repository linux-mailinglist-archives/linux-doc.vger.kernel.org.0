Unfortunately I am only a patch monkey for SPI NOR these days and do not
have any time to do reviews, especially for big series. I mainly check
for reviewed patches and try to apply them. Even that is becoming harder
these days since I am more busy at new $DAYJOB.

I understand your frustration, and do take the blame for this, but
unfortunately can't promise anything better in the future. We pretty
much don't have any active reviewers in SPI NOR. Michael and Tudor are
also short on time these days. If your employer cares about SPI NOR,
perhaps you can encourage them to support developers in helping out with
reviews and maintenance.

Applying the reviewed patches reduces the total patchset size and does
make things easier to review and land. So I don't get why you are so
opposed to the idea.

But anyway, I'll bite the bullet here and apply the series. You
generally have high quality patches so I am not super worried about this
to begin with. We can deal with the bugs or shortcomings later I
suppose...
