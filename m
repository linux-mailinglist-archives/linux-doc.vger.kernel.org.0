Sure.

Anyway, if you want to fix PDF later, I suspect that simply adding:

	.. cssclass:: longtable

Before each quiz table should be enough to fix, as the tables there seem
to be simple enough. 

After fixed, the PDF and LaTeX output are usually decent.

You should either do CSS or PDF, as otherwise you will end with dirty
hacks like:

.. only:: html

	<some quiz table with answers using css>

.. only: latex

	<some quiz table with answers using footnotes>

E. g. you'll need to place the quiz twice, making it harder to maintain
and messier.

Btw, the LaTeX may also parse a css tag, processing it via some custom
macro (with should be added at Documentation/conf.py.

Great!
