Indeed. Just to make it explicit; if we were to support all architecturally
compliant BBML2 implementations, we would need to drop the final patch in this
series. But since it sounds like we will be taking the approach of only allowing
these optimizations for implementations that never raise conflict abort and
handle it all in HW, it should be safe to keep the optimization in that final
patch. I'll work with Miko to get this bashed into shape and reposted.
