So you basically want to force the workload into some sort of a proactive
reclaim but without an artificial slow down?
It makes some sense to me, but
1) Idk if it deserves a new API, because it can be relatively easy implemented
  in userspace by a daemon which monitors cgroups usage and reclaims the memory
  if necessarily. No kernel changes are needed.
2) If new API is introduced, I think it's better to introduce a new limit,
  e.g. memory.target, keeping memory.high semantics intact.

Thanks!
