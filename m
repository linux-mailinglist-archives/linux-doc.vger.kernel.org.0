I don't really remember what we were talking about in 2019 for this, but
look at how many of each there are in the tree:
	402	debugfs_remove
	627	debugfs_remove_recursive

so we need to pick one and just stick to it.  Majority wins?  Shortest
function name wins?  Most descriptive winse?

Naming is hard.

As debugfs doesn't really care about files vs. directories it just
doesn't matter.

Let's just pick one and be done with it please.  Especially now that we
are reviewing the rust bindings for it, let's not end up duplicating
that mess there.

Never call WARN().  If you do, you just rebooted the box because a few
billion Linux machined have panic-on-warn enabled.

So I'll defer to you, which one do you want?  You originally said
debugfs_remove(), which is fine, but you get to send a patch touching
all of those files :)
