The script in the original mail will handle two important cases for me:

1. The "wrong ID" case, where the the provided commit ID doesn't exist
and we need to look at the subject line to figure out what the actual ID
is.

2. The case where we either get a too-short commit ID that has a
collision, or we just got unlucky and finally ended up with a 12-char
collision, but the subject line is enough to automatically resolve to
the correct ID.

We're disagreeing over the remaining <0.0001% of cases.

Not necessarily "evil", but consider something similar to the UMN saga
where we get "researchers" trying to sneak in commits that create a
collision. Once these make it in, it will be difficult walking them back
out.

No, but it makes for a "good" undergrad research paper...

No, it's not a problem. In my mind, I figured we could use shorter
hashes in mail message to make it easier to communicate.

It doesn't have to be formal, but for example if we exchange mails about
an issue, and I end up referring to '1d1a ("arm64/sme: ...")' it both
makes the mail more readable, but still someone who doesn't have context
can still easily get to the commit I was referring to.

To me, it's a nice (minor) improvement.
