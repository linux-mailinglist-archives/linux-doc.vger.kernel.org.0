Yes please. [POC NOT-FOR-MERGE] perhaps?

Yep.

My immediate response is that now we'd need to search multiple sets of lists
instead of a single one? What about the overhead?

Having a POC (even vibe-coded) for measuring that overhead might be actually
useful to quickly figure out whether the idea is viable or not.

But then the code doesn't need to be sent as a huge series if it's not for
review. As Lorenzo said, git repo link is enough.

How can we have a cake and eat it too? :)
