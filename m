Subject: [PATCH v3] dm ima: updates to grammar and some details in documentation
Date:   Wed, 12 Jan 2022 17:51:17 +0100
Message-Id: <20220112165117.2030908-1-public@thson.de>
X-Mailer: git-send-email 2.34.1
MIME-Version: 1.0

List-ID: <linux-doc.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-doc@vger.kernel.org

The grammar for the events dm_device_remove, device_resume and
dm_table_clear did not include the no_data entry when device data
and hash are missing.

For the device uuid or name "=" is also escaped with a "\".

Add a note that dm_table_load might split its target measurements over
multiple IMA events.

v3: fixed missing spaces
v2:
- include also device name and uuid in grammar for no_data
- fixed spelling mistakes
