Yeah, I'm not too worried about that... the uAPI isn't being designed
around the kernel driver, so unless we're deprecating GEM or something
we should be good!

Sounds good.

I also see kernel start/end being passed in at VM creation. I'm confused. At the very least, this needs a much better comment than the one above.

Added a bunch of comments in v4.

This mirrors firmware limits. Either we have to split in userspace or
kernelspace. And at least if we split in userspace, there are no
surprises about where oversynchronization happens.

TBH, I agree. If we need it for something later we can revisit but by
design this should never matter and current Mesa doesn't do anything
with it anyway.

Dropped in v4.

I've added comments in v4 to clarify.

This does raise the question of, maybe drm_asahi_get_time should be
returning time in nanoseconds instead? I'm tempted to make that change
in v4. That would let us get rid of one of the parameters.

In practice the firmware-written "user" timestamps are themselves in
nanoseconds but we don't want to make that uAPI. We can't scale those in
the kernel (what if we write timestamps and then immediately
vkCmdCopyQuery them? We don't want to force a CPU roundtrip/stall just
for that.)

The kernel-read timestamps on current systems are from a 24MHz SoC-wide
reference clock, which both the GPU and CPU share. We can scale these in
the kernel to nanos, which is what userspace does itself currently.
Kind of bikeshed territory but meh?

As far as we know, the fault control register must be set during GPU
initialization and cannot be changed once we're booted. So, we can
override it only via a kernel command line parameter.

macOS enables soft fault in all production builds. We do too these days,
but we have a kernel cmdline flag to disable soft fault / enable hard
faults to aid debugging.

Mesa queries this parameter to determine whether it can speculate
aggressively loads out of control (CAN_SPECULATE) -- it can with
production Asahi systems but not when I'm running CTS on my dev box.

Maybe more problematically, Mesa also currently gates sparseBuffer on
this flag, although I'm probably going to rewrite the sparse buffer
implementation in the coming months to avoid that dependence for various
reasons.

Should I avoid releasing an upstream Mesa with sparseBuffer advertised
until the dependence is dropped, to avoid a theoretical uAPI break if we
wanted to change this policy later? (where the regression is "old Mesas
in containers lose sparseBuffer/FL12").
