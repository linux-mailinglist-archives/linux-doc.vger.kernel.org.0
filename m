As I'll be preparing such patches for merge along this week, I'd
like to know what do you prefer in terms of directories:

1. Keep it as-is;
2. have a separate library directory for Python modules
   (scripts/lib?);
3. place python modules inside scripts/;
4. place python modules inside Documentation/sphinx (IMO a bad
   idea);
5. something else

-

Btw, I'm considering to also submit later a patchset similar to
this one converting kernel-doc to Python. I already started writing
something like that (written from the scratch, following as much
as possible what we have today on Perl to avoid regressions).

I would probably split the code into separate classes to make the code 
more readable/maintainable (a base class, a class with rest output,
another one with man output, and a few other helper classes).

Thanks,
Mauro
