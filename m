Nico,

While I stand by the below, and we very well might wish to delay this until
the next cycle, I will try to take some time to go through this myself as
soon as I am able.

If David's happy with it for this cycle, and I don't find anything too
crazy, then it's not impossible we could still move forward with it now.

My only aim here is to avoid rushing something in that might have
unexpected changes or issues in it, given how late in the cycle we are :)

Cheers, Lorenzo
