The existing wording in the 'Select the recipients for your patch'
section of submitting-patches.rst states that contributors should
'copy' maintainers and lists, which might be interpreted to mean that
patch e-mails should be sent 'Cc' such recipients without any 'To'
recipients at all.

Indeed, this does happen on occasion (and to be fair, examples of the
practice predating the submitting-patches document exist in kernel
mailing list archives). It isn't a problem on the protocol level, as
SMTP itself deals only with SMTP commands (cf. 'RCPT TO'), but
software that works with MIME headers in message text, perhaps in
order to generate those commands, doesn't always handle the situation
well.

At present, when such an e-mail is sent to the vger listservs, the
MIME header 'To: unlisted-recipients:; (no To-header on input)' is
added to it somewhere along the chain. 'unlisted-recipients:;' is a
valid RFC 5322 Group Address, but it (or '(no To-header on input)')
sometimes goes on to cause problems itself further down the line.

For example, in mutt, it can result in the silent removal of all 'Cc'
recipients (e.g. kernel mailing lists) from a group reply, leaving
the 'To' recipient that the original e-mail was 'From' as the only
actual reply recipient [1]. Other issues [2] are possible in other
software [3]. It also bears mentioning that a lack of 'To' headers is
a characteristic of some spam, so such an e-mail may trigger some
spam filters.

To reduce ambiguity and eliminate this class of potential (albeit
tangential) issues, prescribe sending patches 'To' maintainers and
'Cc' lists. While we're at it, strengthen the recommendation to use
scripts/get_maintainer.pl to find patch recipients, and move Andrew
Morton's callout as the maintainer of last resort to the next
paragraph for better flow.

 linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org should be used by default for all patches, but the
 volume on that list has caused a number of developers to tune it out.  Please
 do not spam unrelated lists and unrelated people, though.
