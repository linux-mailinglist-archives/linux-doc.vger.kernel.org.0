Yes, it's more about making this series easier to be accepted, and it'll be
great to have others' input.

Btw, just to mention that I don't even think fail fork() on failed trylock() is
against "logical correctness of fork()": IMHO it's still 100% correct just like
most syscalls can return with -EAGAIN, that suggests the userspace to try again
the syscall, and I hope that also works for fork().  I'd be more than glad to
be corrected too.
