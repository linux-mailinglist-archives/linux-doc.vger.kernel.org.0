Thanks for preparing this.  As you know I had a lot of trouble writing
the NBD ublk daemon and this would have helped.  TBH I would suggest
anyone trying to write a ublk daemon just looks at this source:

On the general topic of this, the qemu developers would greatly prefer
that there are not multiple qcow2 implementations.  I believe the plan
is to modify qemu-storage-daemon (a daemon containing the qemu block
layer) to implement ublk.  I don't think you really need to mention
qcow2 though since it'll be implemented.

Is this command synchronous?  ie. When it completes, is /dev/ublkb*
definitely present in the /dev filesystem?  (I'm going to guess this
depends on something complicated about udevd).

Is it advisable for non-root to be able create arbitrary /dev devices?
It sounds like a security nightmare because you're exposing
potentially any arbitrary, malicious filesystem to the kernel to
parse.
