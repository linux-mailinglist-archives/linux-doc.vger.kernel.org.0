It's no longer needed, please trust us. Last week we've seen about one
duplicate every day and some bugs had up to 2 duplicates. I tried myself
to ask my *local* LLM to find bugs in a certain class over the whole net
tree, and it found one of the recently pubished ones without me having to
give it any hint about this.

Really, these days LLMs can swallow huge amounts of data and correlate
complex patterns very easily over an immense context. You don't need to
ask them to analyze a patch anymore nor to work on this or that file.

An issue found by an LLM is just a proof that this issue CAN BE FOUND by 
an LLM, thus a good indication that someone else will find it, and very
likely that someone else might already be using it.

It's really not how it works nor how it worked.

What is important is that we insist on no longer sharing PoCs publicly.
This will slow down script kiddies (who are the ones doing the most
damage because they don't need the bug for their business yet they cause
harm using it). Criminals are probably already playing with it and might
have been for weeks or months already.

No :-(  If you saw the flood we're receiving on s@k.o, feels like
taking a shower under the niagara falls. Sometimes we just say "trim
this and repost it, it's too long we can't read it".

No, really not at all. Not since the last month at least.

We regularly update the doc based on circumstances so we don't need to
care now. It looks like AI-based reports consume the doc and this will
make them less painful to maintainers, which is already a great thing.
