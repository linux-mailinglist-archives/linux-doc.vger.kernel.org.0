Fixed.  Sorry, old habits die hard.

I won't bother with the tearoff text, though, it that's OK -- that
won't go into git.

OK, sounds good.

I was trying to follow the prevailing line length; but I guess the
lines existing lines were already shortened by flowing the text, so I
misjudged it.

Fixed locally.

Is there a view on how to flow new text? (not so applicable here)

Keeping the lines a bit short (say, 72 chars) means that minor edits
and typo fixes can be applied without extraneous diff noise most of the
time.  I find reviewing an entire re-flowed paragraph annoying when
there is really just a one-word change buried in the middle of it
somewhere.

Equally, I try to avoid reflowing text for minor edits unless
absolutely necessary; poking a few chars over 80 seems tolerable in
that situation, but I prefer it not to go too far...

This comment was pretty trivial to begin with, but grew.

Done.

I've fleshed this out a little, as follows:

--8<--

/**
 * resctrl_arch_preconvert_bw() - Convert a bandwidth control value to the
 *				  appropriate form for consumption by the
 *				  hardware driver for resource r.
 * @val:	Control value written to the schemata file by userspace.
 * @r:		Resource whose schema was written.
 *
 * Return:	The converted value.
 *
 * It simplifies the x86 RDT implementation to round the value to a suitable
 * step at parse time and then treat the resulting value as opaque when
 * programming the hardware MSRs later on.  In this situation, this hook is the
 * correct place to perform the conversion.
 *
 * Architectures for which this pre-conversion hook is not useful should supply
 * an implementation of this function that just returns @val unmodified.
 */
u32 resctrl_arch_preconvert_bw(u32 val, const struct rdt_resource *r);

-->8--

Does that look like enough?

Cheers
