It will be if we somewhat frequent when reclaim an empty PTE page table
as soon as it turns empty. This not only happens when zapping, but also
during writeback/swapping. So while writing back / swapping you might be
left with empty page tables to reclaim.

Of course, this is the current approach. Another approach that doesn't
require additional refcounts is scanning page tables for empty ones and
reclaiming them. This scanning can either be triggered manually from
user space or automatically from the kernel.

Yes, absolutely. I can see the beauty in the current approach, because
it just reclaims "automatically" once possible -- page table empty and
nobody is walking it. The downside is that it doesn't always make sense
to reclaim an empty page table immediately once it turns empty.

Also, it adds complexity for something that is only a problem in some
corner cases -- sparse memory mappings, especially relevant for some
memory allocators after freeing a lot of memory or running VMs with
memory ballooning after inflating the balloon. Some of these use cases
might be good with just triggering page table reclaim manually from user
space.
