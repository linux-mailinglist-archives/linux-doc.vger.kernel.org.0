Given I figure you did this on with a -rc1 based tree, which would mean
that what I wrote probably does not fit the bill, but I tried to do
something along these lines with
https://docs.kernel.org/process/maintainer-soc.html
for which my target audience was people picking up maintenance of
DT/soc drivers, which I hope there'll be a few of in RISC-V land soon...

I suggested adding things to it, like putting the trees in linux-next
etc, but review feedback suggested that was unsuited to a subsystem
specific document.

Thanks,
Conor.
