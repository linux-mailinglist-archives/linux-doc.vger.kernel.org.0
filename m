I try to add all tags that are meaningful, but a lot of times I already
pulled in the patch, and there's been several times tags came in after I
did a pull request to Linus! (for fixes patches). Once I do a pull request to
Linus, only Linus can have me change that commit (if there's an issue with
it).

For linux-next, I will add tags, even when Linus told me to avoid doing so.

That said, I have ignored several "Reviewed-by" tags when they appear
random. If you send a "Reviewed-by" without a single comment, and I don't
know you, it is meaningless to me, and I will not add it.

Now for people I don't know, if they came in and found an issue with a
patch which requires another revision, I will most definitely add their
Reviewed-by for the next version (if they send one), and will likely take
Reviewed-by tags from them in the future without comments (up to a point).

There's also been several cases that someone sent a Reviewed-by tag and
when I take a look at the patch I find an obvious bug. That will cause me
to ignore that reviewer in the future. Adding that tag comes with
responsibilities. As I mentioned in another thread, if I give a Reviewed-by
and a bug happens on that commit, I will spend time to help fix it.
