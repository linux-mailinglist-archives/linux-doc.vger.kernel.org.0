Ok, but this may increase the doc generation time, and would make clang
mandatory for doc generation. As you mentioned, most developers have
clang installed already, so it shouldn't be a big issue.

The real challenge is really how to do such change without
introducing regressions.

The way I see is that we should first convert it to Python with all
regex stuff inside, and then find ways to switch to either libclang
or to some other lexical analyzer library.

This will break existing stuff, as Kernel-doc language uses, for
instance, %const and @symbol, which aren't part of Sphinx. Also,
Sphinx doesn't support inlined comments. DRM, in particular, has
a lot of those, but other subsystems are also big fans of inlined
comments.

IMO we still need a command-line interface as it makes a lot easier
to debug stuff. So, just using Hawkmoth directly may be problematic,
depending on how easy/hard would be to create a command line interface
for it, but yeah, we can take a look on how it works and consider it
at the future of kernel-doc.

This is actually done in separate from the rest of the script.

Yet, the output filtering logic needs to cope with internal, exported,
nosymbol and "function" (actually symbol) logic.

This is the hardest part and what makes dump_struct, dump_function
and  create_parameterlist functions complex.

Even with a lexical analyzer (based or not on libclang), I
suspect we'll still need a lexical ruleset to parse Kernel macros,
as those are actually extensions to C language.

Most of the kernel-doc maintenance are due to such macros.

Separate C and comments is the easiest part of the script, and it is
already there. This is done by a state machine: comments are sent to the
comments-parsing function, while C is sent to process_proto function.

The in-lined comments are harder to parse, as it requires an extra
logic to detect the end of a function/enum/struct, but also handled by
the state machine.

I haven't seen much maintenance on most of kernel-doc code. The big
headache is how to maintain process_proto work.

The actual implementation is trivial:

    def process_proto(self, ln, line):
        """STATE_PROTO: reading a function/whatever prototype."""

        if doc_inline_oneline.search(line):
            self.entry.section = doc_inline_oneline.group(1)
            self.entry.contents = doc_inline_oneline.group(2)

            if self.entry.contents != "":
                self.entry.contents += "\n"
                self.dump_section(start_new=False)

        elif doc_inline_start.search(line):
            self.state = self.STATE_INLINE
            self.inline_doc_state = self.STATE_INLINE_NAME

        elif self.entry.decl_type == 'function':
            self.process_proto_function(ln, line)

        else:
            self.process_proto_type(ln, line)

[1] see the Python's conversion of kernel-doc at:
	https://lore.kernel.org/linux-doc/20250213170413.39caf2d7@foz.lan/T/#me4149c5a2ea5be7bb9659273c4e6cc48f837c36a

So, basically, it dispatches inlined comments to the comments parser.
The code/data are dispatched to two functions:

	- process_proto_function (function and function-like macros);
	- or process_proto_type (data) - which dispatches into
	  dump_function/dump_enum/... functions, and has an
	  ancillary function to parse struct/enum/function parameters.

I would say that at least 95% of the maintenance efforts are
there. The hardest part of it is basically due to C macros we use at
the Kernel.

If we switch to libclang to handle process_proto, we'll still need to 
add lexical extensions to such macros.

Agreed: the same issues we have with the regular expressions we have
at dump_struct and dump_function (which are the core of the issues)
will still require some lexical rules to libclang - or whatever lexical
parser we use.

The advantage of regular expressions is that they're there for years,
and lots of developers are familiar with that. On the other hand,
some of them are really complex to deal with, like:

	- struct_group*
	- syscalls;
	- trace events
	- ...

-

The way I decided to port kernel-doc to python was based on a different
criteria:

1. Keep it as close as possible to the existing script, as it makes
   easier to debug it;

2. Use classes to encapsulate the logic;

3. I placed the core of the parser, including the state machine
   handling, on a KernelDoc class. The entire parser is there;

4. The C part of the parser uses an ancillary Namespace variable:

	self.entry = argparse.Namespace

   which is filled by process_proto and their ancillary routines.
   Once the Kernel-doc entry is ready, there is a store() function
   that adds them to a list of Kerneldoc entries:

	self.entries["entry"].append((name, args))

   I opted to use Namespace, as IMHO it is cleaner to work like
   if this is a C struct than to use a dict.

5. Extra features like output filtering for internal, external, symbol,
   no symbol handling at parsing time;

6. format output is done by separate classes:

	- class OutputFormat: with common code and some "virtual" 
	  dispatchers;
	- class RestFormat(OutputFormat): handles ReST output;
	- class ManFormat(OutputFormat): handles man/troff output.

7. the OutputFormat class does the symbol output filtering.

8. right now format output clasees just use print(), but I'm planning 
   to convert the message output function into an iterator with 
   something like:

		yield (file_name, line_number, output_data)

   to allow the Sphinx extension to get each symbol in separate
   (just like I did for get_abi.py).

-

If we decide to use a separate C lexical analyzer, my suggestion
would be to move the functions that handle struct.entry (basically
process_proto and its ancillary functions) to a separate class and
then re-implement it using libclang (or some other lexical analyzer).

Thanks,
Mauro
