...or just ignore it.  There is a reason that "pip" is called "pip"
rather than "pip.py" - the Python folks don't keep those extensions on
commands either.

No doubt we could do that.  But is it really worth the trouble?  There
is not much in kernel-doc that needs documenting, especially since you
did the work to move the actual functionality into separate modules.

Instead, I think you're trying to take a functionality meant to describe
APIs and use it to document command-line stuff.  I'm happy to live by
the import rules for stuff that is actually imported; I think it makes
less sense to let them drive the naming of files that are outside of
their intended scope.
