So this doesn't apply to docs-next, of course, since there is no such
file.  Looking in linux-next, I see a few things to comment on beyond
these issues...

 - We *really* don't want to be adding more files like this to the top
   level; we have a directory hierarchy for a reason.  This looks like it
   belongs (mostly) in the core-api manual.

 - Can the user-space example be instead turned into a working program
   under samples (or perhaps a test under tests/)?

The first of these, at least, I would really like to see fixed before this
goes upstream.

Thanks,

jon
