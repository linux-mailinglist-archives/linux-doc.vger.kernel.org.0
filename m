Maybe we add this _roc ABI for this device and figure out scaling issues on new devices

With multiple channels, I'd say that is already figured with the standard "enable" ABI,
As the "symbol" to select is a choice of one of the channels to enable. Like it is
being done here for the single tone profiles. Being externally controlled is a user
problem, being its responsability to make sure that expectations on the values are
aligned during some specific actions. For instance, this very driver, expects the selected profile
to be trully selected by the profile pins so that RAM loading works. Also, there is another
weird case, where the profile needs to be selected to make sure a read of the profile register
works (which is another reason to use cached reads). Apart from those cases, I suppose
profile pin control can be "detached" from the driver.

Yes, that could be done. This would be just informative, and I suppose that
any userspace software that knows how to control the part would not even
look at those. Probably it would just be used while debugging.

Right now, I am not seeing anything generic in RAM control appart from a
"sampling_frequency". A lot of it seems device-specific:

- Destination (freq/phase/amplitude/polar)
- Internal profile control config (sequenced modes I had before)
- Per-profile config:
	- Start address
	- End address
	- Address step rate (sampling freq)
	- RAM mode:
		- direct switch
		- ramp-up
		- bidirectional
		- bidirectional continuous
		- ramp-up continuous
	- No-dwell high bit (specific to ramp-up mode)
	- Zero-crossing bit (specific to direct switch mode)

All those values represent the same set of registers with different scaling for
frequency, phase or scale units. I can get the other values to return -EBUSY
when reading a destination attribute that was not set.

I will remove this then. I suppose that adding another possible value for
scale_roc allows us to go around this, i.e., if scale_roc is such that the
amplitude step is a value equal or greater than the amplitude itself (or even the
max amplitude value) I could assume that this would be the manual mode with pinctrl
enable as it would be like an automatic mode with no ramp, but an immediate on-off
transition. Then scale_roc == 0 means manual mode with pinctrl disabled.
Will try to develop on this....
