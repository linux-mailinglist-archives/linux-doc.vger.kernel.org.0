It looks good to me!

ok, I can try to capture a trace sample and represent it into the ASCII art
format above.

To go in that direction, we need to track things that delayed the IRQ execution.
We are already tracking other IRQs' execution, but we will have to keep a
history of past executions and "playback" them. This will add some overhead
linear to the past event... and/or some pessimism.

We will also have to track IRQ disabled sections. The problem of tracking IRQ
disabled is that it depends on tracing infra-structure that is not enabled by
default of distros... And there are IRQ delay causes that are not related to the
thread... like idle states... (and all these things create more and more states
to track these things)...

So, I added the timer irq latency to figure out when the problem is related to
things that delay the IRQ, and the stack trace will help us figure out where the
problem is in the thread context. After the IRQ execution, the thread noise is
helpful - even without all the thread noise before the IRQ.

Furthermore, if we start trying to abstract the causes of delay, we will find
the rtsl :-). The rtls events and abstractions give us the worst-case scheduling
latency without adding unneeded pessimism (sound analysis). It covers all the
possible cases, for all any schedulers, even without the need of a measuring
thread like here (or with cyclictest) - and this is a good thing because it does
not change the target system's workload.

The problem is that... rtsl depends on tracing infra-structure that are not
enabled by default on distros, like preempt_ and irq_ disabled events.

So, I see timerlat as a tool for on-the-fly usage, like debugging on customers
(as we do at red hat). It can be enabled by default on distros because it only
depends on existing and already enabled events and causes no overhead when
disabled. rtsl targets more specific cases, like safety-critical systems, where
the overhead is acceptable because of the sound analysis of the scheduling bound
(which is rooted in a formal specification & analysis of the system).
