Ah, I think I see what you're getting at now. I think it would be reasonable to
split out a drm_trace_buffer from the current code for this purpose. We could
have an interface like:

struct drm_trace_buffer *drm_trace_buffer_init(unsigned int num_pages);
int drm_trace_buffer_resize(struct drm_trace_buffer *buf, unsigned int num_pages);
int drm_trace_buffer_printf(struct drm_trace_buffer *buf, const char *format, ...);
int drm_trace_buffer_output(struct seq_file *seq);
void drm_trace_buffer_cleanup(struct drm_trace_buffer *buf);

Then to Joonas' point, we could have drm_trace_log which uses this interface to
mirror the logs with a debugfs interface.

Would that work for your purpose?

Yeah, I assumed this wouldn't be enabled during normal operation, just for
debugging (as it is used now).
