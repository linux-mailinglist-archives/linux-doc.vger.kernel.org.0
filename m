Can you tell me a bit more about the use case for this?  Nobody has
asked for it so far...  I'm not really opposed to adding it, but it
would be nice to know why.

"This change also ... " is a red flag saying that you should have split
it into a separate patch.

That change may be a bit harder to accept, since it's a behavioral
change that will certainly annoy some people.  At a minimum, it would
have to be coordinated with the automated docs builds at kernel.org.
One could certainly make the case that we should have done things this
way from the beginning; I'm a bit reluctant to change it now.

Thanks,

jon
