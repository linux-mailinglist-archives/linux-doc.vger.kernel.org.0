+1. Although now ublksrv seems to be the only one userspace implementation, I
expect that developers can directly use ublk_drv's UAPI. Maybe I will do
so while embedding ublk into our own backend.

Let me explain UBLK_IO_NEED_GET_DATA since it is designed by myself.

Without UBLK_IO_NEED_GET_DATA, ublk_drv will copy data from biovecs
into a pre-allocated buffer(addr is passed with the last COMMIT_AMD_FETCH ioucmd)
while processing a WRITE request. Please consider two cases:

(1)  if the backend(such as a dist-storage system using RPC) provides the data
     buffer, it has to provide the buffer IN ADVANCE(before sending the last
     COMMIT_AMD_FETCH) without knowing any knowledge of this incoming request.
     This makes existing backend very hard to adapt to ublk because they may
     want to know the data length or other attributes of the new request.

(2) If the backend does not provide the data buffer IN ADVANCE, ublksrv must
    pre-allocates data buffer. So a additional data copy from ublksrv to
    the backend(such as a RPC mempool) is unavoidable.

With UBLK_IO_NEED_GET_DATA, the WRITE request will be firstly issued to ublksrv
without data copy. Then, backend gets the request and it can allocate data
buffer and embed its addr inside a new ioucmd. After the kernel driver gets the
ioucmd, the data copy happens(from biovecs to backend's buffer). Finally,
the backend gets the request again with data to be written and it can truly
handle the request.

ublksrv sends UBLK_IO_COMMIT_AND_FETCH_REQ to "ublkdrv", not "ublksrv", I think.

BTW, "ublkdrv" is very similar to "ublksrv"... Maybe we should use "ublk_drv"?

In the READ case, userspace does not know exactly when the data copy happens.

The data buffer(add is passed with current UBLK_IO_COMMIT_AND_FETCH_REQ) is
reused for a future request(the same tag).

More specifically, whthout UBLK_IO_NEED_GET_DATA, if the future request is a
write request, this buffer is filled with biovecs' data before ublk_drv passes
the request to userspace. BTW, that's why UBLK_IO_NEED_GET_DATA is introduced.
Otherwise the read buffer is actually reused for a future write buffer...

Zhang.
