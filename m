I would go for scripts/lib then.

I took a look on Markus work: it was licensed under GPL 3.0 and it was
written in 2016. There were several changes on kerneldoc since them,
including the addition of a regex that it is not compatible with
Python re[1]:

        $members =~ s/\bSTRUCT_GROUP(\(((?:(?>[^)(]+)|(?1))*)\))[^;]*;/$2/gos;

This one use:

	- recursive patterns: ?1
	- atomic grouping (?>...)

Also, it is hard to map what he does with the existing script. I'm
opting to write a new script from scratch. I have already a version
that does ReST conversion (still missing man pages and filtering).
I'll send a RFC patch once I get it to the point it works properly.

[1] In the specific case of such regex, added on this commit:

	 50d7bd38c3aa ("stddef: Introduce struct_group() helper macro")

    I'm not sure why a very complex regex was used there. I'm currently 
    stuck on handling it properly in Python. An option would be do to:

	try:
		import regex as re
		has_regex_advanced_features = True
	except:
		import re
		has_regex_advanced_features = False

    And, if has_regex_advanced_features is false, use a simpler regex 
    that would work in Python or would just ignore struct_group
    expressions.

    Another option would be to re-implement such regexes without using
    such advanced patterns.

Thanks,
Mauro
