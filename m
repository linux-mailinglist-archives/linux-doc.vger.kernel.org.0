Pretty much, but the internal policies are expected to have precedence
over the external ones, since they are set for some reason to meet their
specific requirements. The external ones are used only when there is no
internal policy active.

Agreed. What about a syscall only apply to per-mm? There are precedents
like process_madvice(2).
