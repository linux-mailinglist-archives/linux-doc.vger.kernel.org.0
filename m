This is the right thing to do, thanks for looking into this!

As for the behaviour of .remove() I doubt whether in many cases
the original driver authors have even tested this themselves.
I would say we should just apply the series as soon as it's non-RFC
after the next merge window and see what happens. I doubt it
will cause much trouble.

The series:
