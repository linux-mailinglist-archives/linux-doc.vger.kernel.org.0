You're completely missing the point. I'm referring to the whole of the
commit message, which is more of a marketing slide than a technical
description.

I really don't care about the getter at this stage, which while
pointless, does not make things more awful than they already are.

This is not a thing. Either *all* the CPUs have a PMU that can be used
for KVM, or PMU support is not offered to guests. That's a hard line
in the sand. And the code already upholds this by checking the
sanitised PMUVer field.

How is that possible? Please describe the case where that can happen,
and I will make sure that such a system stops booting. The intent is
definitely that that:

- for early CPUs, we take the minimal capability of all CPUs

- for late CPUs, either they match at least the capability recorded by
  early CPUs, or they don't boot.

That's not just desired. This is a requirement. And it is already
enforced AFAICS.

I don't think this is correct. Filtering is completely at odds with
this patch, and I don't want to have to reason about the combination.

That's not what I meant. This code is only here to support the
fixed-function feature. It makes no sense outside of it, because *we
don't support counter migration across implementations*.

So what's the purpose of this stuff for the normal KVM setup?

Well, not that loop, since ICNTR is counter 32. So please let's stop
the nonsense and only add what is required?

KVM_ARM_VCPU_PMU_V3_SET_PMU is not a probing mechanism. You must probe
the PMUs by looking in /sys/bus/event_source/devices/, like kvmtool
does.

So there is no reason to support this stuff, and the two flags should
be made mutually exclusive.

At the very least I want to see some documentation explaining that.
