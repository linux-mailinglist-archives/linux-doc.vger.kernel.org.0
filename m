Hmm, that does make sense. I still feel a bit odd doing this, but since
I don't have any better ideas, I think let's keep this as-is. If this
does turn out to be a real problem, we can fix it later. This is kernel
internal API anyway.

Also, I didn't know the plan was to do VFIO only. I thought at some
point in the near future we will get support for PF drivers. With only
VFIO, I think this is a lot simpler and problems will be a lot easier to
fix since there is only one user. I was mainly worried about random
drivers holding on to PCI/LUO core data structures.

But then you'd need to have a lifetime for the xarray, no?

Right, for only VFIO this doesn't make much sense. I wrote this thinking
we will add PF preservation support at some point.
