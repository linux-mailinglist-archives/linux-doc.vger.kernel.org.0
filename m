And for error messages such as this problem, it should include
file name and line number along with the position.  Is position
in this case offset from the beginning of file or beginning of line?
What a bad error message.

[ah, I see that Michal has found where the error happens.]


I have been going thru some of the Documentation/ files...

Why do several of the files begin with
(hex) ef bb bf    followed by "=================="
for a heading, instead of just "===================".
See e.g. Documentation/timers/no_hz.rst.

thanks.
