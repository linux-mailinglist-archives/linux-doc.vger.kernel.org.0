As reported by Sphinx:

	Documentation/filesystems/f2fs.rst:229: WARNING: Malformed table.
	Text in column margin in table line 126.

	====================== ============================================================
	background_gc=%s       Turn on/off cleaning operations, namely garbage
...
	test_dummy_encryption
	test_dummy_encryption=%s
	                       Enable dummy encryption, which provides a fake fscrypt
	                       context. The fake fscrypt context is used by xfstests.
	                       The argument may be either "v1" or "v2", in order to
	                       select the corresponding fscrypt policy version.

This table is now broken, as some texts are bigger than a
column. While it would be feasible to fix it by adding two extra
positions at the table, it would still output something wrong,
as "test_dummy_encryption" would appear on a separate row.

So, the best solution here seems to remove the table markup.

The html and PDF output won't be as nice as a table, but it will
still be reasonable.
