See my previous mail and commit 18d7d01a0a0e ("mtd: spi-nor: Avoid
setting SRWD bit in SR if WP# signal not connected"). Personally, I
really don't like the "software" write protection, I mean you can
just use read-only for that partition or whatever. Locking for me is
really backed by the hardware. I.e. we use that to be really sure,
that we have a bootable bootloader and no one can break it.

I don't have a strong opinion here, but locking might be on a finer
granularity than sectors. Not with the BP scheme but IIRC I've seen
locking schemes with 4k blocks for example. So maybe just something
more general like "locked_erase_blocks_map" or just
"locked_blocks_map", up to you.  It's just debugfs ;)

Oh I meant caching it in the core/swp.c (and invalidating/updating
when the bits are written) and just display it here. That way we
just keep that reading this file won't actually trigger any SPI
xfers.
