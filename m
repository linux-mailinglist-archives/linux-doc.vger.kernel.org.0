IMO it totally depends on whether there is something useful in the
thread on lore. I see no point adding the links if they're just a
regurgitation of something conveyed in a commit message.

But then again, I don't bother adding a lore link to patchsets I apply
either. I'm in the Torvald's camp of only using those tags to link to
things containing "actual new information". There was a discussion of
that a while back, see [1] & [2] if you care, although it was largely
born out of frustration at links added by maintainers to original
submissions, not subjectively redundant bot emails.

Following that logic, I didn't bother adding one here, just as I
wouldn't for a compilation error if I included it in the commit log.

We've probably spent more time typing emails about it than the issue
warrants, but that's par for the course I suppose!

Iff the bot knows its own message-id before sending, I think that could
be nice to have. Does Intel's mail system may support that?
