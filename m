Hi Petr, thanks for taking the time to review this

I'm sorry for that and I hope you're better now.

Indeed, I mentioned that in the patch. Maybe I should've been clearer in the
background description.

Well, I think that some things may not be too obvious for beginners and that
documenting them explicitly is a positive thing overall. I don't think this kind
of comments (comment blocks before a function prototype, not interleaved in the
code) pollute the code or make it harder to read, but that's a personal opinion,
I guess.

I agree that this might introduce a maintainance overhead when it comes to
sync'ing the code and the documentation but, on the other hand, printk.h isn't
something that changes too frequently, is it?

Best regards,
Ricardo
