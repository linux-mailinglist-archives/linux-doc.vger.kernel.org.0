This would be handled by just disabling killswitch in those scenarios like how
we do with lockdown, no?

My question was more about how to structure killswitch as an LSM. I want to be
able to poke at pretty much any function in the kernel, rather than restrict
access to a known list of functions.

Right. We have different usecases. If you want selinux/lockdown/etc and a
really crippled root, that should be an option. If you choose to allow
something like killswitch, it should be an option too.
