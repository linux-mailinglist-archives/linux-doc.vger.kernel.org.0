Unfortunately that's how the firmware works and since we do a shutdown
on module unload, if you have ccp=m this is the behavior.

Maybe it makes sense to go the other way: have perf look for a ccp
symbol that's loaded that says whether RAPL is usable or not, and
refuse to allow access to the counters if it is? But it looks like
there are several UAPIs for this (perf, /dev/amd-hsmp-*, sysfs), so
it's not just one place, which is also ugly.

I was thinking of the ioctl() for retrieving them, but doing the
masking in sev_get_snp_policy_bits() since it would be able to
remember whether RAPL_DIS was set or not. Of course I merged the two
in my head when typing the sentence :)

I haven't tested this, but I would hope what you describe an error. I
think Tom means it's supported by the architecture, it just needs to
be enabled via reconfiguration.
