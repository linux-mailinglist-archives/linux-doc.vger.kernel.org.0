Core KHO preserves contiguous ranges of unmovable physical memory, that 
is it. Preserving physical addresses and folios falls into that 
category, and everything else is built on top of it.

The underlying implementation is where the ABI contract is defined. 
Unlike kho_preserve_pages(), which just tracks raw physical ranges, 
kho_preserve_vmalloc() must serialize non-contiguous virtual memory. To 
do this, it passes metadata kho_vmalloc, kho_vmalloc_hdr, linked list of 
PFN arrays.

I do not understand why you are so against the modularization of 
higher-level implementations on top of KHO. Moving them to dedicated 
files makes the codebase cleaner and easier to maintain. For instance, 
at some point we might support sparse or partially filled vmalloc areas 
where VA size > PA size, or areas that have holes.

Keeping all of that in a single KHO file is the wrong approach and goes 
against how other logically separated subsystems in Linux are organized 
(e.g., mm/vmap.c, mm/vmalloc.c, etc.). Yes, there are some messier 
places in the kernel as well, but keeping this in its own dedicated 
kho_vmalloc.c file makes complete sense to me.

The only reason it was moved to vmalloc.h in this series is because kho 
vmalloc is currently the only user of DECLARE_KHOSER_PTR / 
KHOSER_STORE_PTR in the tree. I can move it to the newly introduced 
compat.h to keep it in a shared place.

However, overall enforcing the use of KHOSER is unrelated to this work. 
I have my own thoughts on this, and perhaps with proper versioning, 
using KHOSER_PTR everywhere would be appropriate, but let's keep that as 
a separate work.

LLMs are great, and we should absolutely rely on them. Spending time 
defining LLM rules and helps in the long term, but none of that is an 
excuse for keeping the codebase messier than necessary. Having the 
codebase logically separated and modularized is still the right 
approach; ease of human review should always be prioritized, even with 
LLM assistants.

Localized context is incredibly powerful for preventing human error. 
When a developer modifies a structure in vmalloc.h, the corresponding 
compatibility version is right there in front of them in the same file, 
making it far more obvious that a version bump is required. In a 
monolithic header, it's easy to modify a structure on line 100 and 
completely overlook a global version defined on line 10.

Modular files drastically reduce noise in git history and diffs. If a 
reviewer sees a patch touching include/linux/kho/abi/vmalloc.h, it is an 
immediate, high-signal flag that a specific ABI is being altered.

Even LLMs behave much better when the context window is smaller. An LLM 
can read a focused file and understand the interactions much more 
accurately, compared to polluting its context with a unrelated 
subsystems.

This is not a logical argument, nothing is have to... Keeping headers 
aligned 1:1 with their implementation files provides clean 
encapsulation, prevents transitive dependency pollution, and ensures 
that ABI changes are tightly localized.

That is a fair point.

As I mentioned in my previous reply, we can definitely look into making 
the version checking more modular. For example, each component could 
implement a standard compatibility-checking interface.

These checks could run early in boot to determine whether each component 
is capable of accepting the incoming preserved data format.

Whenever the component is later used by LUO, memfd, etc., we can query 
that cached status. This achieves four key benefits:

1. It avoids delaying the compatibility check to the actual time of data 
retrieval, which is too late to safely abort.

2. It prevents a local incompatibility from triggering a global kernel 
panic, allowing us to handle failures gracefully for just that specific 
component or session.

3. It keeps the local version local, as you suggested, so it is checked 
only by the consumers of that specific component.

4. It provides a clean path for backward compatibility, as components 
can individually decide whether they understand the incoming data 
format.

That is actually very similar to what I am proposing—individual version 
tokens (which in my current series are concatenated into a composite 
compatibility string separated by ';').

But let's not get too fixated on the composite string formatting. I 
actually really like what you are proposing: using integers for versions 
and having each registered component carry its own "NAME" and version 
number in the KHO FDT.

AFAIK, for everything but KHO itself is going to be FDT free. I would 
like to be strict about that going forward :-)

+1.
