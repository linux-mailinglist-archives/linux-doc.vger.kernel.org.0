Right, so one current idea is to have a single total_mapcount and look 
into removing the subpage mapcounts (which will require first removing 
_nr_pages_mapped, because that's still one of the important users).

Until we get there, also rmap code has to do eventually "more tracking" 
and might, unfortunately, end up slower.

To be fair, a lot of the details are not readily available and in the 
heads of selected people :)

Peter, if you're interested, we can discuss the current plans, issues 
and ideas offline!
