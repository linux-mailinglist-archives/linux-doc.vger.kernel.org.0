Hello,

It's my pleasure to have contact with you, based on the critical
condition I find mine self, though, it's not financial problem, but my
health, you might have know that cancer is not what to talk home
about,
I am married to Mr. Shine Zuthimalin   who worked with Tunisia embassy
in Burkina Faso for nine years before he died in the year 2008.We were
married for eleven years without a child. He died after a brief
illness that lasted for five days.
Since his death I decided not to remarry, When my late husband was
alive he deposited the sum of US$ 10 .2m (ten  million two hundred
thousand dollars) in a bank in Burkina Faso, Presently this money is
still in bank. And My Doctor told me that I don't have much time to
live because of the cancer problem,
Having known my condition I decided to hand you over this fond to take
care of the less-privileged people, you will utilize this money the
way I am going to instruct herein. I want you to take 30 Percent of
the total money for your personal use While 70% of the money will go
to charity" people and helping the orphanage.
I don't want my husband's efforts to be used by the Government. I grew
up as an Orphan and I don't have anybody as my family member,
I am expecting your respond
Mrs. Shahinaz Zuthimalin
