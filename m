It's been a while since the k10temp documentation has been updated.
There are new CPU families supported as well as Tdie temp was added.
This patch adds all missing families which I was able to find from git
history and provides more info about Tctl vs Tdie exported temps.

 If the BIOS has enabled hardware temperature control, the threshold at
 which the processor will throttle itself to avoid damage is available in
 temp1_crit and temp1_crit_hyst.
+
+On some AMD CPUs, there is a difference between the die temperature (Tdie) and
+the reported temperature (Tctl). Tdie is the real measured temperature, and
+Tctl is used for fan control. While Tctl is always available as temp1_input,
+the driver exports Tdie temperature as temp2_input for those CPUs which support
+it.
+
+Models from 17h family report relative temperature, the driver aims to
+compensate and report the real temperature.
