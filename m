css_create() was protected under cgroup_mutex, but I don't believe 
css_free_rwork_fn() is. It is called from the kworker. So atomic_t is 
still needed.

To make it hierarchical, I would have to store a nr_descendants and 
nr_dying_descendants in each css, just like the corresponding ones in 
cgroup. I think it is doable, but the patch will be much more complex.
