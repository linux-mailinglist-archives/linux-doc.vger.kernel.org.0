as you pointed below, (3) and (2) serve the same purpose. 
and I think a possible usage is to migrate between a non-mdev device and
an mdev device. so I think it's better for them both to use (2) rather
than creating (3).

yes. but I think if the condition happens, it should be reported a bug
to vendor driver.
should I add a line in the doc like "vendor driver should ensure that the
migration compatibility from migration_version under mdev_type should be
consistent with that from migration_version under device node" ?

hmm, is it useful for userspace to test the migration_version under mdev
type before it knows what mdev device to generate ?
like when the userspace wants to migrate an mdev device in src vm,
but it has not created target vm and the target mdev device.

so change (1) to migration_type_version and (2) to
migration_instance_version?
But as they are under different locations, could that location imply
enough information?
