That is currently the intention, yes. In the common HDMI state
helper, hdmi_try_format_bpc will return false if a format isn't
supported by the sink at a certain bpc, and ultimately, make its
caller return -EINVAL if it's not supported at any bpc.

Userspace asking for something impossible will result in userspace
being told so during atomic check, or at least that's the intention.

Yeah, my patch has an MST implementation for i915 and it does "work"
for the simple case where monitors don't have different sets of
supported formats, but I think it's better we make MST just not
have the property. May also drop it from amdgpu as a consequence.

My general approach so far has been that we should never feed
the sink anything it can't handle. This results in some fun edge
cases, e.g. my primary monitor (ASUS XG27AQDMG) does support
YCbCr 4:2:0 on all modes, but since I'm talking to it from an
HDMI 1.4b device, it only exposes the two modes in the EDID it
sends the device as YCbCr 4:2:0 that need it. In that case, the
kernel is stricter than the sink because it takes it by its word.
I think forcing userspace to make safer choices is preferable over
having the monitor lose its picture. If people want to be
adventurous, they can always override the EDID, and thus get away
with such things.

Kind regards,
