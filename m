Sure, but on the other hand, lots of those have warnings. Even if
not part of htmldocs, IMO the kernel-doc markups should reflect the
actual code.

We can run it without actually building htmldocs. The only requirement
is to have Python 3.6 or above (this is enough to get error reports,
but 3.7 is needed to avoid having struct/function parameters out of
order).

The real problem is that, when we start doing it, Kernel build will 
have thousands of warnings. 

Perhaps one solution would be to have an image of our current
problems on a file, reporting only new stuff by default and using
WERROR policy, causing build to fail on new warnings.

This would at least avoid the problem to increase.

It is a lot more if you check warnings for files with kernel-doc outside 
the htmldocs build and if you enable all kdoc warnings:

	$ time ./scripts/kernel-doc -Wall . --none 2>warnings

	real    0m33,063s
	user    0m31,233s
	sys     0m0,753s

	$ grep Warning warnings|wc -l
	36965

almost 37K warnings.


Thanks,
Mauro
