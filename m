Thank you for the detailed explanation.

So I compared logs from "make SPHINXDIRS=driver-api htmldocs" with
Sphinx 2.4.4 and 4.5.0 on current docs-next.

There are 8 more lines in the log from 4.5.0 than from 2.4.4, give
or take minor format differences.

Here are those extra 8 lines (long lines are kept):

----
/wk/Documentation/driver-api/usb/usb.rst:967: WARNING: Duplicate C declaration, also defined at usb/gadget:775.
Declaration is '.. c:struct:: usb_string'.
/wk/Documentation/driver-api/miscellaneous:48: ./drivers/pwm/core.c:679: WARNING: Duplicate C declaration, also defined at miscellaneous:305.
Declaration is '.. c:function:: int pwm_capture (struct pwm_device *pwm, struct pwm_capture *result, unsigned long timeout)'.

Declaration is '.. c:function:: void ieee80211_tx_status (struct ieee80211_hw *hw, struct sk_buff *skb)'.
----

So those "WARNING: Duplicate C declaration" messages are what you
mentioned earlier, aren't they?

I'm looking at Documentation/driver-api/usb/usb.rst:967 and
usb/gadget.rst:775, but can't figure out what is/are wrong.

How am I supposed to interpret those messages?
Are those line counts of intermediate files or some such?

Ah, by "PDF and html generation", you meant build errors.
Now I understand what you said.

This sounds hard if not impossible...
