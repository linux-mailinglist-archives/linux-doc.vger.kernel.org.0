For me, it sounds reasonable to accept a public reply about someone
testing a patch as a reason to add a tested-by tag. Yet, I don't add 
tested-by myself based on replies. What I do when someone sends 
a reply saying that the patch was tested is to request the tester to 
reply with a tested-by with a short description about the test scenario.

IMO it is important to ask it to the tester, not only to have an explicit
tag, but also because as a simple tested-by without a test scenario is 
usually not very useful.

Mauro
