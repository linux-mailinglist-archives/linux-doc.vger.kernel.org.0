Hello Ravi,


Thank you for this patch!  TL; DR: Other than trivial things I commented below
and to the patch, I believe it is time to drop the RFC tag, and work on merging
this.

The above link would better to be put on 'Chage since v3' section below.

It is not also in mm-unstable :)

Thank you for addressing all my comments!

I think it could help easy reading if the above sentence also explains
node 0 is DRAM.  For example,

For maintaining hot memory on DRAM (node 0) and CXL (node 1) in 7:3 ratio:

Seems the sentence assumes the actor is in DRAM.  It was not very clear to me.
How about making it clear?  E.g.,

"Move hot pages from DRAM to CXL, if more than 70% of hot data is in DRAM"

If the above example is good for you, to be consistent with it, how about
rewording like below?

"Move hot pages from CXL to DRAM, if less than 70% of hot data is in DRAM"

Your test might be depend on the feature.  But this patch series itself is not,
as users could also use it with CONSIST tuner?

Also, as I mentioned above, the feature is now also in mm-unstable tree.

Sounds reasonable!

Do you plan to further evaluate some performance metrics?  I'd not strongly
request that, but it would be very nice if we can have that.

Regardless of your answer to the above question, I think the current code and
the test is good enough to consider merging this.  I suggest dropping the RFC
tag from the next spin.

Thank you for doing this, Ravi!


Thanks,
SJ
