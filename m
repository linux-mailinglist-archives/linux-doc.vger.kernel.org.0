Sure - Dan's on this thread so I'm sure he'll see it sooner or later.

Perhaps I'm missing something that makes this less critical than it appears.

You can have a single set of handlers, but at the point of spitting the actual
tracepoints out we need to keep spitting the old ones (+ possibly a new unified
one if you want to one day get rid of the separation.)  Bit fiddly but seems
unlikely to be that bad.  e.g. put a wrapper where you currently have
trace_cxl_aer_uncorrectable_error() and have that omit the new and old (based
on device type) tracepoints.  Then when we eventually drop this after enough
years that we can be sure the new one is in use, the code cleanup is all in
one place.

Note this issue isn't a "maybe" thing - we are talking userspace ABI breakage
in an interface known to be in use in commonly used software that is not
typically updated in time with the kernel cadence.  There have been arguments
that some trace points are not 'stable' but that definitely isn't the case for
the RAS ones which are the main interface from kernel to userspace tooling.

In theory you could make such a change and maybe get away with it (on basis
a regression only exists if anyone notices) but you'd need ALL the distros
on board that ship rasdaemon + if you really don't want to end up reverting
you'd have to work closely with the hyperscalers who might decide to throw a
'regression + revert' request at the list which either means a scramble to
put in place what I describe above, or this series being reverted.  Note there
are downstream forks of rasdaemon to content with as well.

That pain just isn't worth it.

Mauro, any idea if any distros scan for RAS tracepoints for compatibility breakage?
They probably should like they do of ioctls and similar but no idea if anyone
actually does yet.  If they do we'd get the revert request pretty quickly...
If not we get to wait for some one to hit it in a functional test 
- thankfully RAS paths are definitely in those test sets but they tend to
run later and hence when a revert / fix is more painful.
