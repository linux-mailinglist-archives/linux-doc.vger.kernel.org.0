I was mostly thinking about very simple KMS clients that only use the most
basic configuration (full-screen buffer with no scaling/cropping). That's
actually a quite common case.

But I see what you mean here, I don't mind keeping the current wording.

Aha! Seems like KMS always has a trick up its sleeve to surprise user-space
devs :)

Yeah, I believe so. Any property (regardless of whether the value actually
changed or not) included in the atomic commit may directly (applied on a CR=
TC
object) or indirectly (applied on a plane/connector linked to a CRTC) pull =
in
a CRTC and have side-effects. (Also, as noted on IRC, a driver might pull i=
n a
CRTC on its own, e.g. when reconfiguring a DP-MST tree.)

Yeah, maybe we should expand the DRM_MODE_PAGE_FLIP_ASYNC docs a bit.
