Thanks for the pointer! I haven't read it before because I assumed
it'll describe workflow and suggestions for SoC sub-tree (which it
does?) I was thinking about something way more basic, like "you are
expected to reply to bug reports", "you are expected to investigate
syzbot problems" etc. :(

IOW the SoC guide reads more like "how to get your code accepted" rather
than "what are the externally-facing responsibilities of a maintainer".
