I think kerneldoc updates should be split out into a separate patch.

[No proper review, just some things I noticed below.]

Should be the "virtio-console (...) device when using PCI...", I guess?

v1.2 is out now :)

Chapter 5 ("Device Types") in the virtio specification [1]

(and add the same reference as above in this file)?

> +defines all the supported Virtio device types. Since these devices are,
> +by definition, meant as abstractions for a wide variety of real
> +hardware, the addition of new virtio drivers is not expected to be very
> +frequent. Still, this document serves as a basic guideline for driver

> +a general overview of Virtio.

Very important point here: Don't add a device driver for a device that
has no reserved device id in the spec. Preferably, don't add a device
driver if no spec is available (it is useful to develop
devices/drivers/spec at the same time to avoid incompatibilities/fixups
later; and you can consider a device spec "final" if it has been
accepted into the spec, even if it isn't in a released version yet.)

(...)

> +This assumes the device is of a new virtio device type not defined
> +before: ``VIRTIO_DEVICE_DUMMY``, which we should define in
> +include/uapi/linux/virtio_ids.h. The device has only one virtqueue which

Don't do that :) You need to make clear that VIRTIO_DEVICE_DUMMY is only
a placeholder.

> +is meant to be used to send data from the host to the guest.
