Absolutely, not gonna ask you to read all of that. :-)

One thing the GPUVA manager does is to provide drivers the (sub-)operations
that need to be processed in order to fulfill a map or unmap request from
userspace. For instance, when userspace asks the driver to map some memory
the GPUVA manager calculates which existing mappings must be removed, split up
or can be merged with the newly requested mapping.

A driver has two ways to fetch those operations from the GPUVA manager. It can
either obtain a list of operations or receive a callback for each operation
generated by the GPUVA manager.

In both cases the GPUVA manager walks the maple tree, which keeps track of
existing mappings, for the given range in __drm_gpuva_sm_map() (only considering
the map case, since the unmap case is a subset basically). For each mapping
found in the given range the driver, as mentioned, either receives a callback or
a list entry is added to the list of operations.

Typically, for each operation / callback one entry within the maple tree is
removed and, optionally at the beginning and end of a new mapping's range, a
new entry is inserted. An of course, as the last operation, there is the new
mapping itself to insert.

The GPUVA manager delegates locking responsibility to the drivers. Typically,
a driver either serializes access to the VA space managed by the GPUVA manager
(no lock needed) or need to lock the processing of a full set of operations
generated by the GPUVA manager.

That sounds like the right thing to do.

However, I'm using the advanced API of the maple tree (and that's the reason
why the above example appears a little more detailed than needed) because I
think with the normal API I can't insert / remove tree entries while walking
the tree, right?

As by the documentation the advanced API, however, doesn't take care of locking
itself, hence just letting the maple tree use its internal spinlock doesn't
really work - I need to take care of that myself, right?

It feels a bit weird that I, as a user of the API, would need to lock certain
(or all?) mas_*() functions with the internal spinlock in order to protect
(future) internal features of the tree, such as the slab cache defragmentation
you mentioned. Because from my perspective, as the generic component that tells
it's users (the drivers) to take care of locking VA space operations (and hence
tree operations) I don't have an own purpose of this internal spinlock, right?

Also I'm a little confused how I'd know where to take the spinlock? E.g. for
inserting entries in the tree I use mas_store_gfp() with GFP_KERNEL.
