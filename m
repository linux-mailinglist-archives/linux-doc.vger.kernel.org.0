Subject: [PATCH] docs: cpufreq: Frequencies are in Hz, not kHz

Though the documentation for the cpufreq files has always specified
that the frequencies are in kHz, they simply aren't. For as long as I
can remember looking at these files they've always been in straight
Hz. Fix the docs.

NOTE: git blame shows that this has been wrong since before the kernel
switched to git. I've tagged the first git commit as Fixes, but we
could easily just drop the Fixes tag if that's a better way to go.
