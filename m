Those are valid points but I don't know how to weave them in without
losing clarity. The goal is also to call out such behavior to
_contributors_, so that they know they can reach out to more senior
maintainers if it happens to them. We don't know when discussion is
taken private (by definition). Otherwise contributors get mistreated 
by some corpo-maintainer and they turn away from Linux :(

Would it help if we speak of "open forums" instead of mailing list?
I think LPC including "hallway track" fall squarely under "conducted 
in a manner typical for the larger subsystem." Here's slightly edited 
version:

  Open development
  ----------------

  Discussions about user reported issues, and development of new code
  should be conducted in a manner typical for the larger subsystem.
  It is common for development within a single company to be conducted
  behind closed doors. However, development and discussions initiated
  by community members must not be redirected from public to closed forums
  or to private email conversations. Reasonable exceptions to this guidance
  include discussions about security related issues.

That's not the message, tho. If someone emails a company privately 
that's fine. If company has internal processes for its development -
also fine (as explicitly called out). I'm trying to set the baseline,
not describe the ideal world.

I am specifically calling out that if someone submits a patch, or
reports a regression the correct response is to review it on the list.
Like a normal person.
Not reply privately that "it's on the company roadmap, just wait" :|
Or reply with a patch company has "forgotten to upstream"..

Maybe it's a cultural thing, but to me this is where the relentless
positivity is counter-productive. I don't want to encourage people
to be angles. I want them not to do the shitty thing.
