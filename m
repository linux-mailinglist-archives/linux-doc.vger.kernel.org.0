This topic pops up every so often, including in yesterday's server
platform TG call. In that call, and, afaict, every other time it has
popped up, the result is to reiterate that ISA extensions never say
anything about performance. So, Zicclsm will never mean fast and we
won't likely be able to add any extension that does.

No problem, let's try to pick the best option. I'll try listing all the
options and there pros/cons.

1. Leave as is, which is to always probe
   pro: Nothing to do
   con: Not ideal in all environments

2. New DT/ACPI description
   pro: Describing whether or not misaligned accesses are implemented in
        HW (which presumably means fast) is something that should be done
	in HW descriptions
   con: We'll need to live with probing until we can get the descriptions
        defined, which may be never if there's too much opposition

3. Command line
   pro: Easy and serves its purpose, which is to skip probing in the
        environments where probing is not desired
   con: Yet another command line option (which we may want to deprecate
        someday)

4. New ISA extension
   pro: Easy to add to HW descriptions
   con: Not likely to get it through ratification

5. New SBI FWFT feature
   pro: Probably easier to get through ratification than an ISA extension
   con: Instead of probing, kernel would have to ask SBI -- would that
        even be faster? Will all the environments that want to skip
	probing even have a complete SBI?

6. ??

I'm voting for (3), which is why I posted this patchset, but I'm happy
to hear other votes or other proposals and discuss.

Thanks,
drew
