Thank you for working to improve the kernel documentation!

There are, though, a few problems with this patch that will need to be
addressed before it can be accepted.  To start, please cc the maintainer
(i.e. me) on documentation changes.

Sticking to the 80-character limit is important for documentation, as it
greatly affects its readability.

> +The two macros ``container_of`` and ``container_of_const``, defined in `=
`<include/linux/container_of.h>``, return a pointer to the ``struct`` (i. e=
. the *container*) from a pointer to a member of this ``struct``.

Please just refer to macros as, for example, container_of(), with
parentheses and without literal markup.  The build code will then do the
right thing.

> +These macros might be used when :ref:`embedding kobjects<embedding_kobje=
cts>`, but see also :ref:`usage<container_of_usage>`.

Referencing a label that is immediately below is kind of pointless.  I'd
delete the label and say "see below".

Also, kobjects are far from the most common use of container_of(), not
sure why the are called out here.

Not sure why two examples are needed, they are showing the same thing?

Sample code should follow the kernel coding style.

At this point you are making changes to documentation unrelated to
container_of().  I'm not entirely sure why you are doing that.  If you
must, though, these changes need to be in their own patch with their own
justification.

Gratuitous formatting changes aren't really useful.
