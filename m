Yes, what you describe is expected behaviour. There is no support yet
for cache capacity (CMAX) or bandwidth priority partitioning and
monitors are only exposed on the L3.

I hope so. The CMAX and the bandwidth priority partitioning should be
easy to add once there is a generic way of adding new schema. There is a
plan/discussion here [1] and I don't expect adding monitoring on L2 to
be hard.
