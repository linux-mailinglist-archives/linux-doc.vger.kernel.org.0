"testing" is not really "testing" if you have userspace tools/programs
assuming the location and contents of specific files in sysfs.

You can change things in sysfs by creating new files, but to do
wholesale renaming like you did here can be very dangerous as you might
be breaking things.  Usually new files are created, not existing ones
moved.

What tools use these today?  What is going to break?
