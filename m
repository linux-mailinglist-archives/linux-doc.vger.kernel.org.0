If we think things like RF DACs (which internally - typically - make use
of things like DDS), we can already go to the GHz "world".

Not saying we already have such a device that would map the new ABI with
bigger values (we might have but nothing I'm aware of from the top of my
head) but just saying the above is, indeed, very likely to pop up at some
time.

Just something to bear in mind :)
