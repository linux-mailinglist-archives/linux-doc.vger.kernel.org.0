Detection of some missing memory barriers has been on the KCSAN feature
wishlist for some time: this series adds support for modeling a subset
of weak memory as defined by the LKMM, which enables detection of a
subset of data races due to missing memory barriers.

KCSAN's approach to detecting missing memory barriers is based on
modeling access reordering. Each memory access for which a watchpoint is
set up, is also selected for simulated reordering within the scope of
its function (at most 1 in-flight access).

We are limited to modeling the effects of "buffering" (delaying the
access), since the runtime cannot "prefetch" accesses. Once an access
has been selected for reordering, it is checked along every other access
until the end of the function scope. If an appropriate memory barrier is
encountered, the access will no longer be considered for reordering.

When the result of a memory operation should be ordered by a barrier,
KCSAN can then detect data races where the conflict only occurs as a
result of a missing barrier due to reordering accesses.

Some more details and an example are captured in the updated
<Documentation/dev-tools/kcsan.rst>.

Some light fuzzing with the feature also resulted in a discussion [1]
around an issue which appears to be allowed, but unlikely in practice.

[1] https://lkml.kernel.org/r/YRo58c+JGOvec7tc@elver.google.com


The first half of the series are core KCSAN changes, documentation
updates, and test changes. The second half adds instrumentation to
barriers, atomics, bitops, along with enabling barrier instrumentation
for some currently uninstrumented subsystems.

Followed by objtool changes to add the usual entries to the uaccess
whitelist, but also instruct objtool to remove memory barrier
instrumentation from noinstr code (on x86), given not all versions of
Clang currently respect __no_kcsan (== __no_sanitize_thread) for the new
instrumentation.

The last 2 patches (new in v3) fix up __no_kcsan for newer versions of
Clang, so that non-x86 architectures can enable weak memory modeling
with Clang 14.0 or newer.

Changelog
---------

v3:
* Rework to avoid kcsan_noinstr hackery, because it is unclear if
  this works on architectures like arm64. A better alternative exists
  where we can get __no_kcsan to work for barrier instrumentation, too.
  Clang's and GCC's __no_kcsan (== __no_sanitize_thread) behave slightly
  differently, which is reflected in KCSAN_WEAK_MEMORY's dependencies
  (either STACK_VALIDATION for older Clang, or GCC which works as-is).
* Rework to avoid inserting explicit calls for barrier instrumentation,
  and instead repurpose __atomic_signal_fence (see comment at
  __tsan_atomic_signal_fence), which is handled by fsanitize=thread
  instrumentation and can therefore be removed via __no_kcsan.
* objtool: s/removable_instr/profiling_func/, and more comments per
  Josh's suggestion.
* Minimize diff in patch removing zero-initialization of globals.
* Don't define kcsan_weak_memory bool if !KCSAN_WEAK_MEMORY.
* Apply Acks.
* 2 new patches to make it work with Clang >= 14.0 without objtool,
  which will be required on non-x86 architectures.

v2: https://lkml.kernel.org/r/20211118081027.3175699-1-elver@google.com
* Rewrite objtool patch after rebase to v5.16-rc1.
* Note the reason in documentation that address or control dependencies
  do not require special handling.
* Rename kcsan_atomic_release() to kcsan_atomic_builtin_memorder() to
  avoid confusion.
* Define kcsan_noinstr as noinline if we rely on objtool nop'ing out
  calls, to avoid things like LTO inlining it.
