So I still don't think that this is appropriate for submitting-patches.rst,
which is already far too long.  It *might* be useful if it were filled out
and added as a separate tutorial document, though.

A few minor comments below...

What is "too old"?  Somebody who needs a tutorial at this level is unlikely

That's an awful lot of configuration that has just been skipped over...

If we're going to make a tutorial, actually say how to do that.

Why on earth would you commit your changes before you test them?

Why wouldn't you put the signoff in the commit?

Haven't you already ensured that you've formatted it correctly?
