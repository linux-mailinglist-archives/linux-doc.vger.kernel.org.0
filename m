Hmmmm. You're right that the old driver was indeed plowing forward
when it got errors. It checks them and does a printout, but then it
throws away the error code and continues executing the rest of the
functions.

Oh! ...but looking at this with fresh eyes, perhaps what the old code
was doing was more correct specifically because this is _unprepare_
and we want to power off even if there were errors. To be explicit:

1. Just because MIPI commands are failing on one link doesn't mean
that they are failing on both links.

2. Even though trying to send "enter sleep mode" after a failed
"display off" will probably fail, it doesn't seem like it would hurt
to try it.

3. You definitely still want all the GPIO / regulator calls even if
the MIP commands failed.

4. Given all the above, I guess one could argue that the sleeps should
all be executed in this case even if the MIPI commands fail.

Maybe something like this would make sense?

/*
* One context per panel since we'll continue trying to shut down
* the other panel even if one isn't responding.
*/
struct mipi_dsi_multi_context dsi_ctx1 =3D { .dsi =3D jdi->link1 };
struct mipi_dsi_multi_context dsi_ctx2 =3D { .dsi =3D jdi->link2 };

mipi_dsi_dcs_set_display_off_multi(&dsi_ctx1);
mipi_dsi_dcs_set_display_off_multi(&dsi_ctx2);

msleep(50);

/* Doesn't hurt to try sleep mode even if display off fails */
dsi_ctx1.accum_err =3D dsi_ctx2.accum_err =3D 0;
mipi_dsi_dcs_enter_sleep_mode_multi(&dsi_ctx1);
mipi_dsi_dcs_enter_sleep_mode_multi(&dsi_ctx2);

msleep(150);

...
...

/* We powered off; return no error even if MIPI cmds failed */
return 0;

What do you think? This is still a small functionality change since
the old code would have returned an error if the second
mipi_dsi_dcs_enter_sleep_mode() returned an error code, but that feels
like it was a bug. That should probably be mentioned in the commit
message.

Right. You'd remove the "failed to set up symmetrical split" error
since all sources of the error would already be reported.

I would prefer if you had a patch #1 introducing mipi_dsi_dual() and
then used it in patch #2. IMO there's no need for you to go back and
re-cleanup "novatek-nt36523". I think the panel you're dealing with is
the second one to have run into this issue during the "multi"
conversion and it's better to get the cleaner solution landed before
others copy.

That being said, I won't insist. You're right that the duplication
isn't any worse with your patch.
