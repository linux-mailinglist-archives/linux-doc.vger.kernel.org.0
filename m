From: Mayank Rungta <mrungta@google.com>

The current documentation generalizes the hardlockup detector as primarily
NMI-perf-based and lacks details on the SMP "Buddy" detector.

Update the documentation to add a detailed description of the Buddy
detector, and also restructure the "Implementation" section to explicitly
separate "Softlockup Detector", "Hardlockup Detector (NMI/Perf)", and
"Hardlockup Detector (Buddy)".

Clarify that the softlockup hrtimer acts as the heartbeat generator for
both hardlockup mechanisms and centralize the configuration details in a
"Frequency and Heartbeats" section.

+=============

+A kernel knob is provided that allows administrators to configure

 Implementation

+Frequency and Heartbeats
+------------------------

+The hrtimer used by the softlockup detector serves a dual purpose:

+The period of this hrtimer is 2*watchdog_thresh/5. This means the

+Hardlockup Detector (NMI/Perf)
+------------------------------
+
+On architectures that support NMI (Non-Maskable Interrupt) perf events,
+a periodic NMI is generated every "watchdog_thresh" seconds.
+
+If any CPU in the system does not receive any hrtimer interrupt
+(heartbeat) during the "watchdog_thresh" window, the 'hardlockup

+
+**Detection Overhead (NMI):**
+
+The time to detect a lockup can vary depending on when the lockup
+occurs relative to the NMI check window. Examples below assume a watchdog_thresh of 10.
+
+* **Best Case:** The lockup occurs just before the first heartbeat is
+  due. The detector will notice the missing hrtimer interrupt almost

+
+    Time to detection: ~6 seconds
+
+* **Worst Case:** The lockup occurs shortly after a valid interrupt
+  (heartbeat) which itself happened just after the NMI check. The next
+  NMI check sees that the interrupt count has changed (due to that one
+  heartbeat), assumes the CPU is healthy, and resets the baseline. The
+  lockup is only detected at the subsequent check.

-Detection Overhead
-------------------
+Hardlockup Detector (Buddy)
+---------------------------
 
-The hardlockup detector checks for lockups using a periodic NMI perf
-event. This means the time to detect a lockup can vary depending on
-when the lockup occurs relative to the NMI check window.
+On architectures or configurations where NMI perf events are not
+available (or disabled), the kernel may use the "buddy" hardlockup
+detector. This mechanism requires SMP (Symmetric Multi-Processing).
 
-**Best Case:**
-In the best case scenario, the lockup occurs just before the first
-heartbeat is due. The detector will notice the missing hrtimer
-interrupt almost immediately during the next check.
+In this mode, each CPU is assigned a "buddy" CPU to monitor. The
+monitoring CPU runs its own hrtimer (the same one used for softlockup
+detection) and checks if the buddy CPU's hrtimer interrupt count has
+increased.
 
-::
+To ensure timeliness and avoid false positives, the buddy system performs
+checks at every hrtimer interval (2*watchdog_thresh/5, which is 4 seconds
+by default). It uses a missed-interrupt threshold of 3. If the buddy's
+interrupt count has not changed for 3 consecutive checks, it is assumed
+that the buddy CPU is hardlocked (interrupts disabled). The monitoring
+CPU will then trigger the hardlockup response (warning or panic).

+1.  **All-CPU Lockup:** If all CPUs lock up simultaneously, the buddy
+    detector cannot detect the condition because the monitoring CPUs
+    are also frozen.
+2.  **Stack Traces:** Unlike the NMI detector, the buddy detector
+    cannot directly interrupt the locked CPU to grab a stack trace.
+    It relies on architecture-specific mechanisms (like NMI backtrace
+    support) to try and retrieve the status of the locked CPU. If
+    such support is missing, the log may only show that a lockup
+    occurred without providing the locked CPU's stack.
