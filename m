I'd say that the reason why you don't see sections of the main index in
the sidebar is because the main index.rst *isn't* listed in any of
"toctree" directives.

So, if you want those "sections" in the sidebar, you need to create
a .rst file and list it in a toctree of main index.

The RTD theme has exactly the same behavior ever since commit
0c7b4366f1ab ("docs: Rewrite the front page").
Furthermore, as there are quite a few pages which belong to multiple
toctrees, sidebar sometimes behaves weirdly.

For example, see the sidebar at:

   https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/next/process/submitting-patches.html
                                         (built on current linux-next)

You will see that the "Submitting patches ..." title is expanded
twice in the sidebar.

Don't you think this looks weird? ;-)

I think the patch appended below (on top of current docs-next)
would have been a better approach, where each .rst file is listed
only once in the whole toctree. The refurbished part of main index
is moved to index-frequent.rst and toctrees are replaced with
lists of :doc: references.

Per-directory indexes are listed in the main index's toctree
below the index-frequent.

I'm not saying this is "the" right approach.
There can be many ways to accomplish the same result, I suppose.

I'll submit this change as a proper patch if I can get positive
feedback.

Hope this helps.

        Thanks, Akira
