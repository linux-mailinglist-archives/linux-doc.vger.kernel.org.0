This is almost certainly our bug, not something in Sphinx.

You can see what our kerneldoc script is generating with a simple:

  scripts/kernel-doc include/linux/highmem.h

Within the output, you'll find the markup for the function in question:

.. c:function:: void * kmap_local_folio (struct folio *folio, size_t offset)

   Map a page in this folio for temporary usage

I am thinking that our automarkup module is getting confused by the
'struct folio' in the prototype there; will try to dig further shortly.

Thanks,

jon
