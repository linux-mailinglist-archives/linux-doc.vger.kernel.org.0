Hi Pavel, Eric,

(Subject-Nit: 'arm64:' is needed to match the style for arm64's arch code. Without it the
maintainer is likely to skip the patches as being for core code.)

Yup, spot on.

Kexec typically wants to place the new kernel over the top of the old one, so its
guaranteed to overwrite the live swapper_pg_dir.
There is also nothing to prevent the other parts of the page-tables being overwritten as
we relocate the kernel. The way the the kexec series chose to make this safe was the
simplest: turn the MMU off. We need to enter purgatory with the MMU off anyway.

(Its worth checking your kexec-tools purgatory isn't spending a decade generating a SHA256
of the kernel while the MMU is off. This is pointless as we don't suspect the previous
kernel of corrupting memory, and we can't debug/report the problem if we detect a
different SHA256. Newer kexec-tools have some commandline option to turn this thing off.)

Turning the MMU off is the simplest. The alternative is a lot more complicated:

(To get the benefit of the caches, we need the MMU enabled to tell the hardware what the
cache-ability attributes of each page of memory are.)

We'd need to copy the page tables to build a new set out of memory we know won't get
overwritten. Switching to this 'safe set' is tricky, as it also maps the code we're
executing. To do that we'd need to use TTBR0 to hold another 'safe mapping' of the code
we're running, while we change our view of the linear-map.

Hibernate does exactly this, so its possible to re-use some of that logic. From memory, I
think the reason that didn't get done is kexec doesn't provide an allocator, and needs the
MMU off at some point anyway.


Thanks,

James
