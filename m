As a maintainer, I mostly use Acked-by for two slightly different cases:

1) I've seen the patch. I have no objections to it being merged, I
   approve of it. I haven't done a detailed review of it. Additionally,
   I may indicate whether a detailed review (by someone else) is
   required, or whether I think the ack is sufficient for merging.

2) I'm fine with the patch to the area I maintain being merged via some
   other maintainers' repositories. I may or may not have also given my
   Reviewed-by in this case, which alone is not an approval to merge via
   other trees.

I think this pretty much aligns with the patch series.

Jani.
