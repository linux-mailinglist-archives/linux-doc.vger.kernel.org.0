    1. Corrected the sentence structure in several places for clarity and readability:
        Original: "those are described below the step-by-step guide"
        Corrected: "those are described below in the step-by-step guide"

    2. Fixed grammatical errors:
        Original: "That why your might need to uninstall the packages with such software to get rid of any 3rd party kernel module."
        Corrected: "That’s why you might need to uninstall the packages with such software to get rid of any 3rd party kernel module."

    3. Improved phrasing:
        Original: "might not what you want."
        Corrected: "might not be what you want."

    4. Clarified instructions:
        Original: "Instead try search terms like the model line"
        Corrected: "Instead, try searching terms like the model line."

These changes ensure that the documentation is more readable and accurate.
