Exactly.  But if you see what I meant here, even if it can work like this, it
sounds still fragile, isn't it?  I just feel something is slightly off there..

IMHO split_huge_pmd() checked pmd before calling __split_huge_pmd() for
performance, afaict, because if it's not a thp even without locking, then it
won't be, so further __split_huge_pmd() is not necessary.

IOW, it's very legal if someday we'd like to let split_huge_pmd() call
__split_huge_pmd() directly, then AFAIU device exclusive API will be the 1st
one to be broken with that seems-to-be-irrelevant change I'm afraid..

This lets me goes back a step to think about why do we need this notifier at
all to cover this whole range of make_device_exclusive() procedure..

What I am thinking is, we're afraid some CPU accesses this page so the pte got
quickly restored when device atomic operation is carrying on.  Then with this
notifier we'll be able to cancel it.  Makes perfect sense.

However do we really need to register this notifier so early?  The thing is the
GPU driver still has all the page locks, so even if there's a race to restore
the ptes, they'll block at taking the page lock until the driver releases it.

IOW, I'm wondering whether the "non-fragile" way to do this is not do
mmu_interval_notifier_insert() that early: what if we register that notifier
after make_device_exclusive_range() returns but before page_unlock() somehow?
So before page_unlock(), race is protected fully by the lock itself; after
that, it's done by mmu notifier.  Then maybe we don't need to worry about all
these notifications during marking exclusive (while we shouldn't)?

Sorry in advance if I overlooked anything as I know little on device side (even
less than mm itself).  Also sorry to know that this series got marked
to-be-update in -mm; hopefully it'll still land soon even if it still needs
some rebase to other more important bugfixes - I definitely jumped in too late
even if to mess this all up. :-)
