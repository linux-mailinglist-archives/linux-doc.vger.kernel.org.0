I am fine with that. As I said I have a patch series saved with just
seqnum_inc() that increments and returns. I anticipated people would
have problems with seqnum_inc() that returns. :)

Are you recommending seqnum32_*() for 32bit and seqnum_*() for 64bit
which would make 64bit as a default? We have to make a distinction
for 32bit vs. 64-bit api.

The idea is isolating sequence number use-case first and restrict this
api for that.
