You're correct that this interface wasn't intended to have usermode
come in with augmented data or additional key/value pairs. This was
purely meant to provide access to the kernel's repository of
architectural and microarchitectural details. If usermode wants to
provide extra info in this same form, maybe they could wrap this
interface.

Correct, this makes allocating bits out of here cheaper by not
requiring that we actively copy them into every new process forever.
You're right that the aux vector would work as well, but the thinking
behind this series was that an interface like this might be better for
an architecture as extensible as risc-v.

I'm not so sure. While I agree with you for major classes of features
(eg one CPU has floating point support but another does not), I expect
these bits to contain more subtle details as well, which might vary
across asymmetric implementations without breaking ABI compatibility
per-se. Maybe some vendor has implemented exotic video decoding
acceleration instructions that only work on the big core. Or maybe the
big cores support v3.1 of some extension (where certain things run
faster), but the little cores only have v3.0, where it's a little
slower. Certain apps would likely want to know these things so they
can allocate their work optimally across cores.

Fixed.
