Ack. Although, we have to have some existing examples for people to
write new families. So you might still have to convert something :-)

I like attribute-set better than attribute-space :-)

Yeah, dunno as well, not sure how much of the per-language knowledge
you should bake into the tool itself.. I think my confusion mostly
comes from the fact that 'name' is mixed together with 'name-prefix'
and one is 'low_caps' while the other one is 'ALL_CAPS'. Too much
magic :-)

Thinking out loud: maybe these transformations should all go via some
extra/separate yaml (or separate sections)? Like:

fixup-attribute-sets:
  - name: header
    canonical-c-name: "ETHTOOL_A_HEADER_{name.upper()}"
  - name: channels
    canonical-c-name: "ETHTOOL_A_CHANNELS_{name.upper()}"

fixup-operations:
  canonical-c-name: "ETHTOOL_MSG_{name.upper()}"

  # in case the "generic" catch-all above doesn't work
  - name: channgels_get
     canonical-c-name: "ETHTOOL_MSG_CHANNELS_GET"

We can call it "compatibility" yaml and put all sorts of weird stuff in it.
New users hopefully don't need to care about it and don't need to
write any of the -prefix/-suffix stuff.

I was thinking that you wanted to do some client size validation as
well? As in sizeof(rx_buf) > ALTIFNAMSIZ -> panic? But I agree that
there is really no value in that, the kernel will do the validation
anyway..
