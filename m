Ah, maybe include that reference in the changelog?

Got it. I think with the back reference to that commit (7118fc2906e2)
it resolves my confusion.

The latter, i.e. would it be worth it to check that a tail page did
not get accidentally pinned instead of a head page? I'm also ok to
leave out that sanity checking for now.
