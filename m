Yeah, one day I might be forced to move to it. There were much more 
assimilation attempts with regards to IPv6... So, far, I've been
resisting  ;-)

This could make sense if this were supposed to work outside Linux 
(or Unix). As this is not the case, we don't need class abstraction
to handle directory deliminator, which is mainly the reason why 
someone writes methods and classes like os.path and pathlib.

Also, os.path has methods already to handle them in a portable way.

In this specific case, it could be using it like:

	sys.path.append(os.path.join(doctree, "/../scripts"))

to do patch contactenation, or, to be portable on other OSes:

	sys.path.append(os.path.join(doctree, "..", "scripts"))

IMO, both are easier to read, and IMHO more direct than:

	from pathlib import Path

	script_path = Path(doctree) / ".." / "scripts"
	sys.path.append(str(script_path))

Also, pathlib is more error prone, as if one does:

	>>> doctree="/tmp"
	>>> import sys
	>>> from pathlib import Path
	>>> script_path = Path(doctree) / ".." / "scripts"
	>>> sys.path.append(script_path)

It ends placing PosixPath() at the list:

	>>> sys.path
	['', '/usr/lib64/python314.zip', '/usr/lib64/python3.14', '/usr/lib64/python3.14/lib-dynload', '/usr/lib/python3.14/site-packages', PosixPath('/tmp/../scripts')]

which I don't thing it would do the right thing to do.

Mauro
