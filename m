Hi Steven, Greg,

I also precede the generation of the fixes tag with an in-depth
analysis.  However, that doesn't conflict with using a git alias to
generate it, once I've reached a conclusion.  I use this alias to
generate them, and it's quite handy:

Indeed.  I agree with this, and it's a quite important difference.
The commit dates are strictly increasing, which means you can use the
date to perform a search of a commit, if there's a collision in the
hash (and possibly in the subject).

I documented this in the man-pages project, where I require the commit
date to appear in Fixes tags.

As I said above, I agree that the commit date is the right choice.
Author dates can be out-of-date-order by years.  Commit dates are
necessarily in order, though.

The possibility isn't zero.  Statistically, it's quite low.  However,
it's non-zero.

Subjects repeat every now and then, and the entropy in some subjects is
actually quite low.

If you include the commit date in a Fixes tag, then you preclude the
entire possibility of a commit reference clash, because you won't have
two patches committed in the same date with the same subject and same
hash (unless you *really* try)

That uses hash+subject.  This may be not enough in some cases (see how
much subjects repeat, in the logs above).  And importantly, a fixes tag
may become ambiguous *after* it has been written, so you can't predict
much.

By having a commit date in the Fixes tag, you could even simplify the
script to just do a binary search in case of ambiguity.  Let's say I
want to find the following commit (arbitrarily taken from the first
Fixes tag I've found in my copy of linux.git):

	a2e459555c5f (2023-08-09; "shmem: stable directory offsets")

We could find it, with a trivial command line.  We only even need two
characters of the hash:

	$ git log --oneline --after=3D'2023-08-08' --before=3D'2023-08-10' \
	| grep ^a2;
	a2e459555c5f shmem: stable directory offsets

No need for a huge script to disambiguate.  This is even typo-resistant,
as one could eventually find something that is similar enough, if one
had such a field with a typo (in any of the three fields).  You'd be
able to search by the other two fields, and two fields should be
_usually_ enough for disambiguating, and the third one could corroborate
the typo.

So, what would you think of having the commit date in commit references
such as Fixes tags?


Have a lovely night!
Alex
