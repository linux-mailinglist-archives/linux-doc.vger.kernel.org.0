The "hardware" in this case is virtual devices presented by the VMM to
the VM. So if a driver misbehaves in a useful way for an attacker to
exploit, they can stimulate that behavior with a custom crafted
virtual device, and that driver will autoload unaware of the threat
without this filter for vetted drivers.
