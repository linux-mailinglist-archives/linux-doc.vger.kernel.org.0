What I'm trying to do is to make sure the reports don't flood just to
maintainers (some of whom never got a report, and getting an intimidating
one written by an LLM can be really painful). And in parallel we're trying
to limit public reports for non-AI. So I think the split point revolves
to:
  - all bugs (AI and non-AI) affecting the threat model are security bugs,
    but AI reports must be considered public as others will find them in
    parallel (and we do know that pretty well now).
  - if non-AI, send to maintainers and Cc: security, send all repros 
    you can share
  - if AI,  the report must be considered public so send to maintainers
    and Cc: public lists AND always LKML, and never security@, and do
    not send the repros publicly.

=> this reinforces the role of security@ to be for triage, coordination
   and assitance to maintainers so that they're never left to themselves
   (i.e. private bugs=maint+s@k.o; public bugs=maint+public list).

Also, I'll add "for AI, please see the points below" (the 3rd patch with
all the rules).

There remains a gray zone with the repros from AI tools (since they're
good at writing them). They should sent to maintainers only (no need to
involve s@k.o) but it requires a second message.

Over the last two weeks I felt like you needed a macro on your keyboard
that would post a link to that doc in lore!

Thanks,
