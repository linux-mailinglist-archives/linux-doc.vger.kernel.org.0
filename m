Please drop "CONTENT_POLICY" from the KVM documentation.  From KVM's perspective,
these are not "policy", they are purely properties of the underlying memory.
Userspace will likely use the attributes to implement policy of some kind, but
KVM straight up doesn't care.

The default behavior absolutely cannot be something that's not supported on
every conversion type.

What entity zeros the data doesn't matter as far as KVM's ABI is concerned.  That's
a motivating favor to providing ZERO, e.g. it allow userspace to elide additional
zeroing when it _knows_ the memory holds zeros, but that's orthogonal to KVM's
contract with userspace.

We should avoid using "hypervisor", because (a) it means different things to
different people and (b) even when there's consensus on what "hypervisor" means,
whether or not the hypervisor is trusted varies per implementation.

Again, say _nothing_ about "the hypervisor".  _How_ or when anything happens is
completely irrelevant, the only thing that matters here is _what_ happens.

No.  I am 100% against bleeding vendor specific information into KVM's ABI for
this.  What the vendor code does is irrelevant, the _only_ thing that matters
here is KVM's contract with userspace.

That doesn't mean pKVM guests can't rely on memory being zeroed, but that is a
contract between pKVM and its guests, not between KVM and host userspace.

pKVM shouldn't be mentioned in here at all.

---
By default, KVM makes no guarantees about the in-memory values after memory is
convert to/from shared/private.  Optionally, userspace may instruct KVM to
ensure the contents of memory are zeroed or preserved, e.g. to enable in-place
sharing of data, or as an optimization to avoid having to re-zero memory when
the trusted entity guarantees the memory will be zeroed after conversion.

The behaviors supported by a given KVM instance can be queried via <cap>.  If
the requested behavior is an unsupported, KVM will return -EOPNOTSUPP and
reject the conversion request.  Note!  The "ZERO" request is only support for
private to shared conversion!

``KVM_SET_MEMORY_ATTRIBUTES2_ZERO``

  On conversion, KVM guarantees all entities that have "allowed" access to the
  memory will read zeros.  E.g. on private to shared conversion, both trusted
  and untrusted code will read zeros.

  Zeroing is currently only supported for private-to-shared conversions, as KVM
  in general is untrusted and thus cannot guarantee the guest (or any trusted
  entity) will read zeros after conversion.  Note, some CoCo implementations do
  zero memory contents such that the guest reads zeros after conversion, and
  the guest may choose to rely on that behavior.  But that's a contract between
  the trusted CoCo entity and the guest, not between KVM and the guest.

``KVM_SET_MEMORY_ATTRIBUTES2_PRESERVE``

  On conversion, KVM guarantees memory contents will be preserved with respect
  to the last written unencrypted value.  As a concrete example, if the host
  writes ``0xbeef`` to shared memory and converts the memory to private, the
  guest will also read ``0xbeef``, even if the in-memory data is encrypted as
  part of the conversion.  And vice versa, if the guest writes ``0xbeef`` to
  private memory and then converts the memory to shared, the host (and guest)
  will read ``0xbeef`` (if the memory is accessible).
