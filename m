long term pin vs short term page reference aren't fully fleshed out.
But the rule more or less is:
- short term page reference: _must_ get released in finite time for
migration and other things, either because you have a callback, or
because it's just for direct I/O, which will complete. This means
short term pins will delay migration, but not foul it complete

- long term pin: the page cannot be moved, all migration must fail.
Also this will have an impact on COW behaviour for fork (but not sure
where those patches are, John Hubbard will know).

So I think for your use case here you want a) short term page
reference to make sure it doesn't disappear plus b) callback to make
sure migrate isn't blocked.

Breaking ZONE_MOVEABLE with either allowing long term pins or failing
migrations because you don't release your short term page reference
isn't good.

Yeah you need some other callback for migration on the page directly.
it's a bit awkward since there is one already for struct
address_space, but that's own by the address_space/page cache, not
HMM. So I think we need something else, maybe something for each
ZONE_DEVICE?

s/possible/need to type some code to address it/ I think.

But also I'm not much of an expert on this, I've only just started
learning how this all fits together coming from the gpu side. There's
a _lot_ of finesse involved.
