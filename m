Hi Vegard and Mauro,

Thanks for your assistance.

Yes, I probably should have checked there earlier. :)

That does work but it made me suspicious.

I was building in a kernel tree that was built from a tarball
and linux-next daily patches.  That leaves behind some *.orig files
(since I use 'patch -b' for "backups").

If I remove the Documentation/ABI/*.orig files, there is no issue
like I had erroneously reported here.
Maybe get_abi.pl is (also) processing the *.orig files and that
somehow causes it to produce the confusing output.

Anyway, nothing to see here. Move along. :)

Thanks again.
