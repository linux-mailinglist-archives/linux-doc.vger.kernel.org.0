Why would you need to touch the PMD entry to prevent GUP-fast races for mTH=

As I see it, you're not "keeping" the current locking behavior; you're
making a big implicit locking change by reusing a codepath designed
for PMD THP for mTHP, where the page table may not be exclusively
owned by one VMA.

As I understand, one rule we currently have in MM is that an operation
that logically operates on one VMA (VMA 1) does not touch the page
tables of other VMAs (VMA 2) in any way, except that it may walk page
tables that cover address space that intersects with both VMA 1 and
VMA 2, and create such page tables if they are missing.

This proposed patch changes that, without explicitly discussing this
locking change.

Just as one example: I think this patch retracts a page table without
VMA-locking the relevant address space (we hold a VMA lock on VMA 1,
but not on VMA 2), and we then drop the PMD lock after (temporarily)
retracting the page table. At that point, I think a racing fault that
uses the VMA-locked fastpath can observe the empty PMD, and can
install a new page table? Then when collapse_huge_page() tries to
re-add the retracted page table, I think we'll get a BUG_ON(). Similar
thing with concurrent ftruncate() or such trying to zap PTEs, we can
probably end up not zapping PTEs that should have been zapped?
