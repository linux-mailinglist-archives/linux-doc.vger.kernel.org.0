Is all of the above arbitrary KVM behavior or defined by the TLFS?

Why?  I mean, I kinda sorta understand what it does for VSM, but it's not at all
obvious why this information needs to be shoved into the APIC IDs.  E.g. why not
have an explicit group_id and then maintain separate optimization maps for each?

Who is "we"?  As a general rule, avoid pronouns.  "we" and "us" in particular
should never show up in a changelog.  I genuinely don't know if "we" means
userspace or KVM, and the distinction matters because it clarifies whether or
not KVM is actively involved in the modeling versus KVM being little more than a
dumb pipe to provide the plumbing.

Please explain the relationship and rules of execution contexts.  E.g. are
execution contexts the same thing as VTLs?  Do all "real" vCPUs belong to every
execution context?  If so, is that a requirement?

This is *extremely* misleading.  KVM forces the x2APIC ID to match vcpu_id, but
in xAPIC mode the ID is fully writable.
