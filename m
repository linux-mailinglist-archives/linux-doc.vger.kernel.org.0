If using one cgroup per process is inefficient, then that's what needs to be 
fixed. Making the API extremely complex to reason about for every user isn't a 
good compromise when we're talking about an already niche use case.

memory.high isn't only for triggering memory reclaim, it's also about active 
throttling when the application fails to come under. Fundamentally it's 
supposed to indicate the point at which we expect the application to either 
cooperate or get forcibly descheduled -- take a look at where we call 
schedule_timeout_killable.

I really struggle to think about how all of those things should interact in 
this patchset.

You can already do that with something like oomd, which has way more 
flexibility than this. Why codify this in the kernel instead of in a userspace 
agent?
