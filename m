The above last sentence is right in a sense, but not useful and could only
confuse readers.  The statistics for DAMOS filters are filters passed size
stat, which is provided as per-scheme accumulated stat and per-region instant
information.  The stat is for any memory that be able to apply the DAMOS action
after the filters check stage.  Hence, whether it has passed the stage due to
existence of a pass filter that matches the memory, or the absence of any
matching filter is distinguishable.

Hence, the above sentence is completely wrong.  The case (installing pass
filtrs without any block filter after those) is not useful even for monitoring
purpose.

The RFC version of this patch was mentioning it correctly, but was not clearly
describing why it is not also useless for even monitoring purpose.  I was also
confused due to the absence of the context.  I will rewrite this part and send
the whole series again as v2.


Thanks,
