 To let users optimize DAMOS schemes with such special knowledge, DAMOS provides
 a feature called DAMOS filters.  The feature allows users to set an arbitrary
-number of filters for each scheme.  Each filter specifies the type of target
-memory, and whether it should exclude the memory of the type (filter-out), or
-all except the memory of the type (filter-in).
+number of filters for each scheme.  Each filter specifies

+- a type of memory (``type``),
+- whether it is for the memory of the type or all except the type
+  (``matching``), and
+- whether it is to allow (pass through the filter) or reject (block) applying
+  the scheme's action to the memory (``pass``).
+
+When multiple filters are installed, each filter is applied in the installed
+order.  If a memory is matched to one of the filter, followup filters are
+ignored.  For example, let's assume a filter for passing anonymous pages and
+another filter for blocking young pages are installed in the order.  If a page
+of a region that eligible to apply the scheme's action is an anonymous page,
+the scheme's action will be applied to the page regardless of whether it is
+young, since it matches with the first filter.  On the other hand, if a page of
+the region is a non-anonymous page, the scheme's action will be applied only if
+the page is young, since the second filter is also applied.
+
+Note that DAMOS action is eligible to be applied to any memory that satisfies
+other conditions if no filter is isntalled.  Meanwhile, DAMOS filters work for
+only memory that satisfies ``type`` and ``matching``.  It means installing only
+pass filters is same to installing no filter, because pass filters dont' block
+memory of type that not specified to pass.  For any use case, at least one
+block filter should be installed as the last one.
 
 For efficient handling of filters, some types of filters are handled by the
