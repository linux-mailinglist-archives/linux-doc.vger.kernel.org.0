my 2cent ..

I have a doubt that translating has to be a part of the kernel development.

Minimal English is one of the prerequisites to be a part of the community.
Maintainers do not master foreign languages, they are forced to commit
blindly without quality assurance.  APIs will never be translated and
the translation of articles is at random.

   IMO a spin-off might focus on translations.
