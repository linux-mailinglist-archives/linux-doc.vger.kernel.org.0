Switches for something like that is just not a good fit.

For example, for a short-lived child (e.g., fork+exec) it usually makes no sense
to cow a larger chunk of address space, when you know that it will exit
immediately either way and free up the memory.

Right, you can only return hugetlb folios by doing MADV_DONTNEED or munmap().

Right, but that really only changes how we map large folios, not how we allocate
them. There are no guarantees.

I'm afraid I have to stop you right there: there has to be a pretty convincing
story to add any of that. In particular KSM with large folios (/me shivering).

But I already don't buy the COW story. Just configure khugepaged in a better way
or use MADV_COLLAPSE and you don't really need to modify the kernel at all in
99.99% of the case. (khugepaged needs a lot of tuning work, it's currently not
the smartest implementation)

Maybe, we might give khugepaged better direction of what to try scanning next
(e.g., where we just COW'ed a THP). Not sure, there are plenty of things to explore.

Okay, what I thought after seeing no workloads an no performance numbers :)

If you don't know the workload, how can you claim that the additional latency
and/or memory consumption is not a problem?

Also: there is no guarantee that you will actually succeed in allocating a PMD
THP during a COW fault.

If your application cares about performance, you either shouldn't be using
fork(), or you should be using it very, very wisely (e.g., interaction with
multi-threading, MADV_DONTFORK, avoid touching memory in parent until child
completed).

There is page migration, MADV_DONTNEED, munmap/mremap/madvise/mprotect in sub-2M
blocks, memory failure handling and probably a lot more. THP allocation might
fail. THP swapout+swapin might fail to allocate THPs.

Tackling COW handling when you don't even know that it's a real problem seems
premature.

No magical toggles.

It's actually the right thing to do (tm) if you care about fork() performance
and know that your child will not actually need certain memory areas.

For example, in QEMU we use it to exclude all guest memory from fork(), heavily
improving fork() performance. [there are not a lot of fork() use cases left in
QEMU today, fortunately]
