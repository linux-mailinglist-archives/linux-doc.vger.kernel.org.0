Hi Luka,

Thanks for reviewing the changes.

Yes, the above two details are correct. In addition to that, I think
the existing equation had a small bug:
GRUB paper says, running time is depreciated as
   "dq =3D -U dt" where U is running_bw.
This is assuming that the whole cpu bandwidth could be reclaimed. But
in our case, we cap at Umax. So the equation should be
   "dq =3D -(U/Umax) dt"

And then we have an upper limit of (1 - Uextra - Uinact). I feel we
should be taking the minimum of these values to make sure that we
don't cross the upper bound. I think the equation should be:
   "dq =3D -min{U/Umax, (1 - Uextra - Uinact)} dt"

But the current implementation is
   "dq =3D -max{u/Umax, (1 - Uextra - Uinact)} dt"
   Where u =3D dl_se->dl_bw.

After fixing the above equation, reclaim logic works well but when only
SCHED_FLAG_RECLAIM tasks are running. When we have a mix of both
normal deadline and SCHED_FLAG_RECLAIM, it breaks the reclaim logic.
As you pointed out, the second part of the fix is for that.

In my testing, I did not see a change in the performance of the
grub_reclaim function. Both old and new implementations take 10 to
20 nanoseconds on average. But my observation might not be accurate.

With this change, it is difficult to avoid division as the denominator
is a variable and we would not be able to pre-calculate an inverse. We
could probably calculate inverse during {__add/__sub}_running_bw so as
to reduce the frequency of div64_u64. I shall try this for v2.

Thanks a lot for pointing it out. Yes you are right, I messed up in the
comments. It should be Uextra and I shall fix it in v2.

Makes sense, it will avoid an extra variable Uinact. I shall modify this
in v2.

Thanks,
