The primary VM is started by RM. Secondary VMs are not otherwise special 
except that they are (usually) launched by the primary VM.

Gunyah supports both of these scheduling models. For instance, 
scheduling of resource manager and the primary VM are done by Gunyah 
itself. A VM that the primary VM launches could be scheduled by the 
primary VM itself (by making a hypercall requesting a vCPU be switched 
in), or by Gunyah itself. We've been calling the former "proxy 
scheduling" and this would be the default behavior of VMs.

We are following Gunyah's naming convention here. For each virtual 
machine, Gunyah maintains a table of resources which can be accessed by 
that VM. An entry in this table is called a "capability" and VMs can 
only access resources via this capability table. Hence, they get called 
"capability IDs" and not "resource IDs". A VM can have multiple 
capability IDs mapping to the same resource. If 2 VMs have access to the 
same resource, they may not be using the same capability ID to access 
that resource since the tables are independent per VM.

I want to establish the framework to build a VM loader for Gunyah. 
Internally, we are working with a prototype of a "generic VM loader" 
which works with crosvm [1]. In this generic VM loader, memory sharing, 
memory lending, cooperative scheduling, and raising virtual interrupts 
are all supported. Emulating virtio devices in userspace is supported in 
a way which feels very similar to KVM. Our internal VM loader uses an 
IOCTL interface which is similar to KVM's.

The basic use case I'll start with is for userspace to create an IRQFD. 
Userspace can use the IRQFD to raise a doorbell (interrupt) on the other VM.

The info is described in 
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/firmware/gunyah-hypervisor.yaml.

I had an offline discussion with Bjorn and he agreed with this approach 
here. He suggested avoiding using the device bus model and will go with 
smaller approach in v3.

The mailbox framework can only fit with message queues and not doorbells 
or vCPUs. The mailbox framework also relies on the mailbox being defined 
in the devicetree. RM is an exceptional case in that it is described in 
the devicetree. Message queues for other VMs would be dynamically 
created at runtime as/when that VM is created. Thus, the client of the 
message queue would need to "own" both the controller and client ends of 
the mailbox.

RM is not loaded or managed by Linux, so I don't think remoteproc 
framework provides us any code re-use except for the subdevices code. 
Remoteproc is much larger framework than just the subdevices code, so I 
don't think it fits well overall.

We don't want to limit VM configuration to the devicetree as this limits 
the number and kinds of VMs that can be launched to build time. I'm not 
sure if you might have seen an early presentation of Gunyah at Linaro? 
In the early days of Gunyah, we had static configuration of VMs and many 
properties of the VMs were described in the devicetree. We are moving 
away from static configuration of VMs as much as possible.
