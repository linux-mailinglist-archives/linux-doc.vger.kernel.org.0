I agree on the removal of the numbered sections.  Those always end up
being wrong after a while.

In general, all of those references and labels clutter the source
considerably and aren't hugely useful to readers of the plain-text
documents.  There are times when they are the best thing to do, but I
think that moderation is indicated.  Just giving the file name will
generate a cross-reference to that file; I would hope that would be
enough most of the time.
