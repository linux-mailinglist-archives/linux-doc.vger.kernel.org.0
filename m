Currently, both MADV_DONTNEED and MADV_FREE obtain the read side of
mmap_lock instead of write side, which is the reason that 
jemalloc/tcmalloc prefer to use madvise() to release physical memory.

Even if it obtains the write side of mmap_lock, how to make sure that
all the page table entries are empty? Traverse 512 entries every time?

Now each level of page table has its own spin lock. Can you explain the
working mechanism of this special rwsem more clearly?

If we can reduce the protection range of mmap_lock, it is indeed a great
thing, but I think it is very difficult, and it will not solve the
problem of how to check that all entries in the page table page are
empty.

The reason why only the PTE page is released now is that it is the
largest. This reference count can actually be used for other levels of
page tables.
