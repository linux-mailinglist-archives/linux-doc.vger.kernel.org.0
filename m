Yes, but only if it's not write-protected before. The text read as
if you could ignore the hardware write protection. More below.

That no-wp property was recently introduced because of faulty
hardware. Before that, locking was always the "real" hardware
write-protection.

Yes that is much better. BTW, I've never seen "#signal" but only
SIG#, nSIG, SIGn or /SIG, maybe I haven't paid too much attention.

What about

    - If you have a WPn pin, you may want to set `no-wp` in your DT for
      the time of the test, to only make use of software protection.
      Otherwise, clearing the locking state depends on the WPn
      signal and if it is tied to low, the flash will be permanently
      locked.

Yes you're correct. I've read the -u for a -l (and somehow assumed
a complete unlock in between).
