On my tests with a simple C tokenizer:

	https://lore.kernel.org/linux-doc/cover.1773326442.git.mchehab+huawei@kernel.org/

The tokenizer is working fine and didn't make it much slow: it
increases the time to pass the entire Kernel tree from 37s to 47s
for man pages generation, but should not change much the time for
htmldocs, as right now only ~4 seconds is needed to read files
pointed by Documentation kernel-doc tags and parse them.

The code can still be cleaned up, as there are still some things
hardcoded on the various dump_* functions that could be better
implemented (*).

The advantage of the approach I'm using is that it allows to
gradually migrate to rely at the tokenized code, as it can be done
incrementally.

(*) for instance, __attribute__ and a couple of other macros are parsed
    twice at dump_struct() logic, on different places.

Probably not, but I don't think we need a C parser, as kernel-doc
just needs to understand data types (enum, struct, typedef, union,
vars) and function/macro prototypes.

For such purpose, a tokenizer sounds enough.

Now, there is the code that it is now inside:
	https://github.com/mchehab/linux/blob/tokenizer-v5/tools/lib/python/kdoc/xforms_lists.py

which contains a list of C/gcc/clang keywords that will
be ignored, like:

	__attribute__
	static
	extern
	inline

Together with a sanitized version of the kernel macros it needs
to handle or ignore:

	DECLARE_BITMAP
	DECLARE_HASHTABLE
 	__acquires
	__init
	__exit
	struct_group
	...


Once we finish cleaning up kdoc_parser.py to rely only
on it for prototype transformations, this will be the only file
that will require changes when more macros start affecting 
kernel-doc.

As this is complex, and may require manual adjustments, it
is probably better to not try to auto-generate xforms list
in runtime. A better approach is, IMO, to have a C pre-processor
code to help periodically update it, like using a target like:

	make kdoc-xforms

that would use either cpp or clang to generate a patch to
update xforms_list content after adding new macros that
affect docs generation.
