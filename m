Yes, kernel-doc does that...looking at the history, that behavior was
added in 2012 (commit 65478428443) because otherwise multi-line macros
are not handled properly.

Fixing this properly is not going to be all that easy; the code reading
the source file is well before any sort of parsing, so it has no idea of
whether it's in a comment or not.

A really ugly workaround... put something relatively inconspicuous, like
"     .", after the backslash, and at least your formatting won't be
mangled.

I don't really do IRC, just don't have the spare attention span for it.
Feel free to email me anytime though.
