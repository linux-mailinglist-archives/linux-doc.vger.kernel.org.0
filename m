kho_preserve_vmalloc() has the same semantics as kho_preserve_folio().
It's not intended to be used as a data structure. The data structure is
an implementation detail unlike with kho_block and kho_radix_tree that
are intended to be used as data structures and expose clear data
structure APIs.

Yes, vmalloc should have versioning, but that does not mean it must move
to different files.

And, btw, moving KHOSER_PTR() infra along with vmalloc is wrong. It was
my oversight that I didn't insist on using it for most of the
serializeable pointers instead of open coded
virt_to_phys()/phys_to_virt(). We need to fix it.

Following this logic, kho_presrve_folio() should be moved out because
it's not used by KHO but has external customers. And radix tree should
forever remain in kexec_handover.c because KHO uses it ;-)

No matter in what files the definition lives, someone can forget to
update version and we may miss it during review.

Would be better to spend this time and energy to add kho-specific prompt
to LLM review to catch such issues ;-)

They could. Doesn't mean they have to.

Sorry I wasn't clear. I agree that kho_vmalloc, block and radix tree
should have their own versioning rather than rely on global KHO version.

What I don't like in your proposal is mixing versioning of a component
with its dependencies.

I think that versioning should be completely local to each component.
LUO should not care about kho_block "on wire" layout. This should be
encapsulated in kho_block.

Backward compatibility will be in scope sooner or later and string
parsing is surely not the way to deal with multiple versions.

How do you suggest to represent support for multiple versions?
"luo-v2;luo-v3;block-v2;block-v3;block-v4"?

If a ->restore() returned an error (for any reason) we anyway need to
reboot, don't we? 

What do we do if memfd discovered incompatibility, but, say hugetlb
global state was already restored?

If you really want to run the compatibility check upfront, we need a
mechanism for that. And that should probably happen even before
kho_mem_init().

Actually FDT "compatible" handles versioning nicer than composite strings
You can have

	compatible="kho-v4", "vmalloc-v1", "radix-v1", "block-v2";

and check fdt_node_check_compatible("vmalloc-v1") for vmalloc and
fdt_node_check_compatible("block-v2") for block.

And we wouldn't need to reimplement string parsing ;-)

But yeah, I do see value of making components versioning and KHO global
versioning independent. I just don't like composite strings and I don't
like mixing versioning with dependencies.

Since we are moving from FDT for the most things, version should become
a number rather than a string and version compatibility should be
independently verified by each component.
Then dependencies between components will remain at API level rather
than brought into the ABI.

If you think ->restore() is too late for compatibility check, we should
work on a mechanism for upfront compatibility verification.
