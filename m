I'd relax that rule a bit. There are resources that drivers must never,
ever access after .remove(), such as MMIO. Using devm_ioremap* should
therefore be safe in all cases.

Yes, and that's why I wrote that my explanation was conceptual :-) I
think it's important for developers (at least the ones developing
subsystem integration for this, if not all driver authors) to understand
the concepts behind it. Then we can optimize performance with the right
kernel primitives. If we start the API documentation by talking about
SRCU, people will be lost.

I didn't see any push back against Dan's proposal to store that
information in struct cdev, did I miss something ?

I think it's the simplest answer, yes. It's a bit like using a canon to
kill a fly though, but all other solutions would I think be much more
complex.
