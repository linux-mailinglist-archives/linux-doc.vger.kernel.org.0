It's been a clear a noticeable improvement, even if there's still work
to do. I trust that you understand the issue.

I wouldn't use the word "fault" here, I don't think you should take any
blame for this. Looking at that particulat patch series, I think sending
a v2 would have helped moving forward.

For this one, Jon replied with a comment, and the discussion died out.
Replying to that could have helped.

In general I'd say you shouldn't be afraid to ping.

Is there anything we can learn from that failure and that number of
reasons to make the next attempt more successful ?

Just an oversight I suppose.

When I'm really not sure if something is a good idea, or when I'm
convinced it's a good idea but I fear other may disagree, I often ask
relevant maintainers and developers on IRC. I don't know if there's an
IRC channel for the Linux kernel documentation, if there are enough
people interested in the topic, it could be useful.

I really don't know if we could count on newcomers interested in getting
into kernel development to start their journey in Documentation/. I can
imagine in theory that someone who tries to follow our documentation and
finds it suboptimal could send patches as a side product of whatever
work they're doing (without wanting to show off, that's how I wrote the
initial documentation for the KMS in-kernel API: I had to write a KMS
driver, had no idea how it worked, and there was no doc), but that will
be a rare occurence and most probably would come from an experienced
kernel contributor. We seem to scare lots of new contributors in
general, so I have a hard time imagining they would actively work on
documentation improvements. There could be exception, but I don't think
we should count on them.
