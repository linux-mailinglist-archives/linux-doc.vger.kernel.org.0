In your first email you also mentioned removing the check in dice_probe()
that only allows a single instance. On a second thought, I think it's
simpler to keep it there for now, even if the memory is dynamically
allocated, which I agree makes the code cleaner.
The reason being that if we allowed multiple instances, we'd also need
some static unique identifier that ties the cdev filename to the DT entry,
same as /dev/disk/by-uuid/. Just adding an index number to the misc
device nodename based on DT probe order sounds very fragile, and
anything more sophisticated sounds like too much trouble for something
we don't have a clear use case for right now.

Alright, read/write it is. And that gets rid of ioctls altogether.
