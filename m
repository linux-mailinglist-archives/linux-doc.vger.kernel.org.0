With KSASLR we may randomize the kernel and module space over a substantial
portion of the vmalloc range. Are you expecting that text replication is going
to restruct that range, or that we'd make it mutually exclusive with KASLR?

I also note that the L0 table could have as few as two entries (with 16K pages
and 4 levels). So either we'd need to also mess with an L1 table, or make text
replication mutually exclusive with such configurations.

As a heads-up, we've just changed MODULES_VSIZE to be 2G in

  https://lore.kernel.org/linux-arm-kernel/20230530110328.2213762-1-mark.rutland@arm.com/

.. which is queued in the arm64 for-next/module-alloc branch:

  https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/arm64/linux.git/log/?h=for-next/module-alloc

That series above also decoupled kaslr_enabled() from kaslr_offset(), 
so we'd only need to change kaslr_offset().

I think the existing conditions here aren't quite right, and have become bogus
over time, and I don't think that the is_kernel() check is necessary here.

Originally, back in commit:

  c1cc1552616d0f35 ("arm64: MMU initialisation")

We had:

	if (virt < VMALLOC_START) {
		pr_warning("BUG: not creating mapping for 0x%016llx at 0x%016lx - outside kernel range\n",
			   phys, virt);
		return;
	}

... which checked that the VA range we were manipulating was in the TTBR1 VA
range, as at the time, VMALLOC_START happened to be the lowest TTBR1 address.

That didn't substantially change until commit:

  14c127c957c1c607 ("arm64: mm: Flip kernel VA space")

... when the test was changed to:

	if ((virt >= VA_START) && (virt < VMALLOC_START)) {
		pr_warn("BUG: not creating mapping for %pa at 0x%016lx - outside kernel range\n",
			&phys, virt);
		return;
	}

Note: in that commit, VA_START was actually the end of the linear map (which
was itself a the start of the TTBR1 address space), so this is just checking if
we're poking a small portion of the TTBR1 address space, rather than if we're
poking *outside* of the TTBR1 address space.

That doesn't make much sense, and I'm pretty sure that was a thinko rather than
an intentional change of semantic.

I "fixed" that without thinking in commit:

  77ad4ce69321abbe ("arm64: memory: rename VA_START to PAGE_END")

... making that:

	if ((virt >= PAGE_END) && (virt < VMALLOC_START)) {
		pr_warn("BUG: not creating mapping for %pa at 0x%016lx - outside kernel range\n",
			&phys, virt);
		return;
	}

... but clearly it has lost the original semantic and doesn't make much sense.

I think the test should actually be something like:

	/* Must be a TTBR1 address */
	if (virt < PAGE_OFFSET ) {
		...
	}

... and then we won't randomly trip for kernel mappings if those fall between
the linear map and vmalloc range.

Thanks,
Mark.
