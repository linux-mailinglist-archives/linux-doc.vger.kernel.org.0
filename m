No, just that the scaler doesn't document the internal hardware
implementation (number of taps in the filters, coefficients, rounding,
...). That's the rule, not the exception, and it doesn't prevent correct
operation, images get scaled in a reproducible way (the same input
produces the same output).

The properties involved here would the the SRC and CRTC rectangles for
the planes. They don't document pixel-perfect scaling :-)

It's not just about buggy hardware, it's also about implementation
specificities, such as rounding, filters, order of operations in the
color management pipeline (it's relatively easy when you only have two
LUTs and a CCM matrix, but if you through 3D LUTs and other tonemapping
features in the mix, not all hardware will implement the same pipeline),
or various types of image compression (this device implements a
"near-lossless" compression scheme that reduces the memory bandwidth by
50% for instance).

I didn't even know a 3D LUT existed before getting the datasheet for
this device. It's a long shot before the community will acquire enough
knowledge to guide hardware design, especially if you consider the
feature of tomorrow's devices that nobody knows about yet. A worthwhile
goal, but not something we can fully achieve, and not in a short time
frame.

I expect some amount of device-specific code in userspace, yes. 

There are usually large variations in how the hardware exposes access to
a given feature, which leads to code having to convert the standard API
parameters to hardware parameters. To a large extend this can be done in
drivers, but for some more complex features, it may put too much burden
on the kernel. There's a reason mesa is a userspace stack :-)
