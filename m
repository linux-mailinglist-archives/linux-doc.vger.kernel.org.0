Indeed, at first glance the test may look simple.
However, despite the high-level concept being straightforward, there
are several corner cases and peculiar aspects that needed to be
covered, that=E2=80=99s why the test grew larger than expected.
For this RFC, my intent was mainly to share the full picture of what I
had in mind.
I fully agree that it can be refined and streamlined in the next iterations=
.
When I started working on this, I wasn=E2=80=99t aware of any existing LTP
tests for this interface.
After your comment, I double-checked, but I couldn=E2=80=99t find any relev=
ant coverage.
As far as I can tell, neither LTP nor the upstream kernel selftests
(kselftest or KUnit) currently include tests specifically targeting
/dev/mem.

Yes, that=E2=80=99s intentional.
The main reason is that all the interactions happen from userspace,
and the internal helper functions aren=E2=80=99t meant to be consumed by ot=
her
kernel components.
So I chose a kselftest-style approach.
That said, this is still an RFC, I=E2=80=99m happy to adapt it based on
community feedback and direction.

That=E2=80=99s indeed one of the nuances I mentioned earlier.
Access to /dev/mem is often restricted for security reasons, so the
test is designed to detect and adapt to the environment, only
performing operations that are actually allowed.

Yes, I used GPLv2+ deliberately, but I=E2=80=99m open to changing it if the
consensus is that GPLv2-only is more appropriate here.

It wasn=E2=80=99t copied, but I agree it looks unnecessary in its current f=
orm.
I can remove or rework it in the next version.

You=E2=80=99re right, this was a small custom debug I left in place, mainly
because I needed a way to include additional information that isn=E2=80=99t
normally part of the standard selftest output, such as references to
specific requirements in the code.
My intent was to make it easier to correlate test results with those
requirements.
That said, I fully agree that the implementation isn=E2=80=99t aligned with
the kselftest framework style, and I=E2=80=99ll look into integrating this
need in a more standardized and consistent way in the next iteration.

Thanks a lot for the detailed feedback, it=E2=80=99s very helpful.
I=E2=80=99ll revise the test accordingly for the next round.

Best regards,
Alessandro
