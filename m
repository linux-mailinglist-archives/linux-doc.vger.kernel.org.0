Hi Maxime,
Hopefully less mangled formatting this time: turns out Thunderbird +
plain text is utterly unreadable, so that's one less MUA that is
actually usable to send email to kernel lists without getting shouted
at.

Sorry it ended up coming across like that. It wasn't the intent.

I don't quite see the same picture from your side though. For example,
my reading of what you've said is that flaky tests are utterly
unacceptable, as are partial runs, and we shouldn't pretend otherwise.
With your concrete example (which is really helpful, so thanks), what
happens to the MT8173 hdmi-inject test? Do we skip all MT8173 testing
until it's perfect, or does MT8173 testing always fail because that
test does?

Both have their downsides. Not doing any testing has the obvious
downside, and means that the driver can get worse until it gets
perfect. Always marking the test as failed means that the test results
are useless: if failure is expected, then red is good. I mean, say
you're contributing a patch to fix some documentation or add a helper
to common code which only v3d uses. The test results come back, and
your branch is failing tests on MT8173, specifically the
hdmi-inject@4k test. What then? Either as a senior contributor you
'know' that's the case, or as a casual contributor you get told 'oh
yeah, don't worry about the test results, they always fail'. Both lead
to the same outcome, which is that no-one pays any attention to the
results, and they get worse.

What we do agree on is that yes, those tests should absolutely be
fixed, and not just swept under the rug. Part of this is having
maintainers actually meaningfully own their test results. For example,
I'm looking at the expectation lists for the Intel gen in my laptop,
and I'm seeing a lot of breakage in blending tests, as well as
dual-display fails which include the resolution of my external
display. I'd expect the Intel driver maintainers to look at them, get
them fixed, and gradually prune those xfails/flakes down towards zero.

If the maintainers don't own it though, then it's not going to get
fixed. And we are exactly where we are today: broken plane blending
and 1440p on KBL, broken EDID injection on MT8173, and broken atomic
commits on stoney. Without stronger action from the maintainers (e.g.
throwing i915 out of the tree until it has 100% pass 100% of the
time), adding testing isn't making the situation better or worse in
and of itself. What it _is_ doing though, is giving really clear
documentation of the status of each driver, and backing that up by
verifying it.

Only maintainers can actually fix the drivers (or the tests tbf). But
doing the testing does let us be really clear to everyone what the
actual state is, and that way people can make informed decisions too.
And the only way we're going to drive the test rate down is by the
subsystem maintainers enforcing it.

Does that make sense on where I'm (and I think a lot of others are) coming =
from?

To answer the other question about 'where are the logs?': some of them
have the failure data in them, others don't. They all should going
forward at least though.

Cheers,
Daniel
