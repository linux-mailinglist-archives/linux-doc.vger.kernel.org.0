I'd support a patch that replaces

Assisted-by: Claude:claude-3-opus coccinelle sparse

with

Assisted-by: LLM # generate some test cases

and rewrites the Attribution section of
Documentation/process/coding-assistants.rst accordingly.

I think most people in this mail thread have expressed that how
generative AI was used is the most important information, and several
people (including myself) have expressed a desire to stop the free
advertising. Unless I missed something, I don't think anyone has
expressed an interest in keeping the agent name and model.
