I am not suggesting new frameworks or re-writing.  Naming as per spec
seems reasonable though, and the issue here is that this is a combined
ETE/ETMv4 driver and the specs differ on the naming.
No problem using the ARM ARM names - perhaps a comment to say which
spec is used for the names would work.

However., the defines do need to be accurate, and the field size does
change with the value of the type bit in the two registers in use in
this patch. As a minimum the define name should indicate that it is
for a single resource field, and we can then add a second define for
the resource pair case if and when needed.

Mike
