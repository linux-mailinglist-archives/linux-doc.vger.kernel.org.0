Sure, the kprobe mechanism is the same under the hood. The differences are in
the policy layer.

It does for observability. Even when the engage path is blocked by integrity
lockdown, the user still has to be able to inspect the killswitch state: which
engagements were applied from the boot cmdline, how many times each has fired,
whether the kernel is tainted by killswitch. /sys/kernel/security/ stays
readable under integrity lockdown while /sys/kernel/debug is restricted by
LOCKDOWN_DEBUGFS as a whole tree.

To be precise about what's being dragged in: killswitch does select
FUNCTION_ERROR_INJECTION, but it does *not* select CONFIG_FAULT_INJECTION (the
broader probability/interval framework that distros stay away from).

This understates what "use fail_function instead" actually requires in a distro
Kconfig. CONFIG_FAIL_FUNCTION depends on FAULT_INJECTION_DEBUG_FS, which
depends on FAULT_INJECTION, which is the broader framework that doesn't get
built into production kernels. So a "rebuild fail_function for production" path
is three configs prod users say no to today (FAULT_INJECTION +
FAULT_INJECTION_DEBUG_FS + FAIL_FUNCTION).

Whether the whitelist is "useless" depends on the framing of what it
was for. In the context of fail_functiom, it isn't a security feature, and
never has been. It's a debugging guardrail in lib/error-inject.c that stops
developers from fault-injecting on functions that don't expect failure
injection during testing. Any kernel that has FAULT_INJECTION compiled in has
already opted out of treating security as the primary concern in that build.

Killswitch doesn't change the whitelist role: kernel/killswitch.c doesn't go
through within_error_injection_list, fail_function still gets to keep its
developer guardrail for testing, BPF's bpf_override_return still uses it too.

In production kernels (where FAULT_INJECTION=n) the whitelist isn't
running anyway. In debug/test kernels (where it is on) it remains useful for
exactly the testing purpose it was added for.

Mostly, sure. Things that are missing are the module handling, for example.


Concretely to merge killswitch and fail_function we need:

   1. Boot cmdline parser (agreed).
   2. A new lockdown reason in the integrity class plus its lockdown_reasons[]
      string.
   3. Moving from debugfs to securityfs (or standing up a parallel securityfs
      interface).
   4. Module-unload notifier.
   5. Taint flag.
   6. Audit logging on engage and disengage.
   7. Fixing up fail_function's API (probability, interval, times) with the
      engage/disengage model.
   8. Production users enabling FAULT_INJECTION + FAULT_INJECTION_DEBUG_FS +
      FAIL_FUNCTION, none of which they do today.

There are already several ways to override a function at runtime: livepatch,
fail_function, BPF kprobe override, an out-of-tree kprobe module. The
underlying machinery is largely the same across all of them. We keep them as
separate facilities because they serve different audiences and different policy
needs, not because each one uses a different underlying technology.

By the "same capability, therefore redundant" logic, fail_function should
already be redundant with livepatch or BPF since both can replace a function's
body with whatever you want.
