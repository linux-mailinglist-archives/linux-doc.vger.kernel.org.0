Even if it's just the patch submission and an "applied" reply.  To me,
that seems to be just noise.

My point with the above scenario is that the discussion that resulted
in the patch being proposed is the relevant discussion that needs to
be linked to the patch - which will include the context about why the
patch was generated and its testing.  The official submission will
contain none of that.

I guess what this is highlighting is that different people have
different ways of working, and trying to force one thing (Link:) to
be used with one way of working doesn't scale across the whole kernel.

So, stating that Link: should only be added by a maintainer or
committer will have a detrimental effect on workflows that do not
match the one you have in mind.
