I just moved this part as-is, and I've been extremely hesitant to change
formatting as I can't easily check the validity of the output.

Not sure what you mean. Is this supposed to be a sub-section and not just a
title ? On https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/security-bugs.html
it appears as the title. This one was already present in the same document
and was moved there without a change.

Thanks a lot for your help!
