This problem is dear to my heart and I have been pondering it on and off
for some time now. The entire fork + exec idiom is terrible and needs to
be retired.

Is this vibe-coded? I asked claude for in-kernel posix_spawn for kicks
some time ago and it generated remarkably similar code. But that's a
tangent.

I'm rather confused by the angle in the patchset. Most of this shaves
off a tiny amount of work, while retaining the primary avoidable reason
for bad performance: the very fact that fork is part of the picture,
especially the part mucking with mm. Creating a pristine process is the
way to go.

Additionally there is a known problem where transiently copied file
descriptors on fork + exec cause a headache in multithreaded programs
doing something like this in parallel. I only did cursory reading, it
seems your patchset keeps the same problem in place.

There are numerous impactful ways to speed up execs both in terms of
single-threaded cost and their multicore scalability, most of which
would be immediately usable by all programs without an opt-in. imo these
needs to be exhausted before something like a "template" can be
considered.

Per the above, the primary win would stem from *NOT* messing with mm.

As in, whatever the interface, it needs to create an "empty" target
process (for lack of a better term).

In terms of userspace-visible APIs, a clean solution escapes me.

Some time ago I proposed returning a handle which is populated over time
by the parnet-to-be. One of the problems with it I failed to consider at
the time is NUMA locality -- what if the process to be created is going
to run on another domain? For example, opening and installing a file for
its later use will result in avoidable loss of locality for some of the
in-kernel data. That's on top of the fd vs fork problem.

From perf standpoint, the final goal of whatever mechanism should be a
state where the target process avoided copying any state it did not need
to and which allocated any memory it needed from local NUMA node
(whatever it may happen to be). Of course if no affinity is assigned it
may happen to move again and lose such locality, nothing can be done
about that. But pretend the process is to run in a specific node the
parent is NOT running in.

So I think the pragmatic way forward is to implement something close to
posix_spawn in the kernel. It may make sense for the thing to take the
PATH argument for repeated exec attempts. I understand this is of no use
in your particular case, but it very much IS of use for most of the
real-world. The initial implementation might even start with doing vfork
just to get it off the ground.

The next step would be to extend the interface with means to AVOID
copying any file descriptors. There could be a dedicated file action
which tells the kernel to avoid such copies or something like a
close_range file action (or close_from) -- with a range like <0, INT_MAX>
you know no fds are copied.

For the NUMA angle to be sorted out, any file action which opens a file
or dups from the parent needs to execute in the child. And frankly
something would be needed to ask the scheduler where does it think the
child is going to run, so that the task_struct itself can also be
allocated with the right backing.

I have not looked into what's needed to create a new process and NOT
mess with mm, but I don't think there are unsolvable problems there, at
worst some churn.

There are of course other parameters which need to be sorted out, that's
covered by the posix_spawn thing.

This e-mail is long enough, so I'm not going to go into issues
concerning exec itself right now.

tl;dr I would suggest redoing the patchset as posix_spawn and then doing
the actual optimization of not cloning mm itself.
