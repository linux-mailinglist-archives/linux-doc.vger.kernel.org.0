Updates the bootloader and installation instructions in admin-guide/README.rst
to align with modern practices.

Details of Changes:

 - Added guidance on using EFISTUB for UEFI/EFI systems.
 - Noted that LILO is no longer in active development and provides
   alternatives.
 - Kept LILO instructions but marked as Legacy LILO Instructions.
   Suggest removal in future patch.
