Yes, d) is more like a preference, since we operate in cgroup level.
Process/thread level interfaces are also acceptable.
AutoNUMA violates c) in its global effect that not only the source
and destination nodes, the processes running on other nodes would
also suffer from unwanted overhead due to numa faults.
And besides the global effect, one-shot mode migration is expected
in this scenario, like cpuset.memory_migrate, rather than autonuma's
periodic behavior.

Such conflicting configuration exists in our system in order to
reduce TCO, and yet we haven't found a proper way to get rid of
it. Say a numa-service occupies the whole memory of a node but
still leave some cpus free. The free cpus may be assigned to some
services, the ones that are not memory latency sensitive and are
forbidden to use local memory. Thoughts?

Thanks,
