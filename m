Well, the purpose of the checkpatch documentation is to provide some
more background information on the warning (e.g., the historic
motivation, what to consider when judging its validity) and any hints
on possible resolutions. So, I would expect to see the documentation
cover explaining the most common (reusable) resolutions. A valid
argument why a check warning can be ignored falls into such a
resolution. In fact, the category "CHECK" in checkpatch.pl already
suggests that often the resolution may be to "inspect some code, but
not modify the code and then further 'ignore' the reported warning",
as some rules in checkpatch are checking something with just some
quite weak heuristics.

So, for this patch here: How about avoiding the word "workaround" and
just state these to options as resolution, e.g., a text like this:

Here are two possible options:
- Check the macro arguments of all uses of this macro to be free of
unintended side effects. Passing a constant value is usually fine, as
the compiler will use constant propagation and further optimizations
to produce acceptable code.
- If needed, define local variables in the macro to hold the macro's
argument. See the implementation of `min` in include/linux/minmax.h as
one example of this option.

What do you think?

I really appreciate you providing some documentation for this rule. I
also appreciate the rules that checkpatch.pl checks being better
explained to all of us in the kernel community. That avoids that we
all, especially newcomers, individually wonder about what checkpatch
intends to warn us about.
