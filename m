What's elaborate?

"Say how much of your patch is LLM written, here are some examples".

Well I certainly don't feel I do :)

I tried pushing back on obvious AI slop and got a huge amount of blow back for
it because the guy wasn't honest about it.

A key reason for me pushing back on the tooling documentation was precisely
because I felt we needed a clear means of doing this.

This being the part:

"As with the output of any tooling, the result may be incorrect or
inappropriate. You are expected to understand and to be able to defend
everything you submit. If you are unable to do so, then do not submit the
resulting changes.

If you do so anyway, maintainers are entitled to reject your series without
detailed review."

But if somebody denies it, no matter how strong the evidence, you can never
really 'prove' it.

I think honestly if there's a newcomer who suddenly out of nowhere does a huge
involved series in an area they've not touched before and LLMs assess it as 90%
likely to be LLM generated,and they reply making mistakes that only an LLM would
make (misinterpreting a field's symbol and then acting as if really exists) -
it's not unreasonable to cite these things as a reason to 'not really trust'
that it's their work.

Perhaps worded nicely to say 'sorry if I'm mistaken'?

All I'm really asking is for the ability to say something like "I reasonably
believe that this is generated, so we need to build more trust here, apologies
if I'm mistaken, but can we see some smaller patches in this area first" or
something like this.

Is this arguing 'we don't have complete information so let's have no
information'? Because I would say something > nothing?

That's creating a lot more work for maintainers?

You could even figure out bug rate from Fixes: tags alone using metadata.
