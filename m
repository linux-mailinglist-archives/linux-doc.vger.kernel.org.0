This is the second posting of arm64 kernel text replication, rebased on
v6.5-rc1.

There are a number of issues outstanding from the previous posting:
- Making it work with different numbers of page tables / page sizes etc
- Using 2-stage page tables to replicate (which needs to be done in
  EDK2/UEFI rather than the kernel.)

The changes since the last version have been:
- rox page protection consolidation patch has been merged
- Mark's VA-range sanity check patch is now also merged which allows
  my changes in that area to be dropped.
- reordered the first three patches

I am not expecting this to be merged, but it would be nice to get a few
more eyes and comments on it - and maybe people trying it out.
