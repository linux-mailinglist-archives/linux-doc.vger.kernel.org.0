It is wasting time ;) .. The Makefile targets do build intermedaiate
files using perl and other scripts, this will never work on RTD.

FWIW: in other projects I worked some time with RTD but at the end
I gave up: If you have e.g. auto generated content in your build
process which is not generated by the python developer-mainstream
tools, RTD gives you too little freedom to implement your more
or less complex build procedures.  And .. often I get the RTD-Oops
links from search engines ..  RTD is (my experience is a  while
ago; "was") not very comfortable to to rebind obsolete URLs to
new content.

Overall I think kernel.org does a good job .. since years, no need
for additional RTD confusions;
