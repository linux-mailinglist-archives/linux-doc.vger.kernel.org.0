OK, we're getting closer...

This sort of information is good to have, but it should be put after the
"---" line.

Kernel documentation should describe the current kernel.  If there is
information in this file that is still useful, please incorporate it into
your new document.  Then just call it user_mode_linux.rst and delete the
old one entirely.

You can do this a bit more concisely:

	Create a sparse raw disk image::

	  # dd if=/dev/zero of=disk_image_name bs=1 count=1 seek=16G

Please use that idiom throughout.

As part of getting these, these subsubsubsection headings could really just
be ordinary paragraphs.

Please stick to the 80-character limit; it really does make a difference
for readable text.

With those small tweaks I think this will be ready to go; it can still
happen for 5.10.  Thanks for working on this.
