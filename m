How could you assume memdesc - 1 exists without performing other checks?

I would guess so.

Hopefully.

So the real question is how this would affect the transition period 
(some memdescs allocated, others not allocated separately) that Willy 
might soon want to start. And the dual mode where, whether "struct 
folio" is allocated separately will be a config option.

Let's wait for Willy's reply.
