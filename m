NAK.

The degree of laziness here is really telling, so yet again I'm sorry I don't
believe you've put much effort into this.

You've not bothered cc'ing the right people, you didn't bother with anythign
other than a cookie-cutter commit message, there's a bunch of issues with the
docs even at a cursary glance.

This is already wrong.

What is a 'backing store' what is a 'disk filesystem', 'written to or faulted
in' is wrong, etc.

I won't go on.

This would become 'development by review' and you'd take up HOURS of our time
while we do the actual work.

This isn't how contributions are supposed to work.
