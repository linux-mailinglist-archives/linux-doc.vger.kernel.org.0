What do you mean with stack va objects?

Right, and I think it might be worth concretely mentioning this in the 
documentation.

Yeah, I think this is not entirely obvious why this is the case. I 
should maybe add a comment on how the callback way of using this 
interface is motivated.

The requirement of pre-allocation arises out of two circumstances.
First, having a single callback for every drm_gpuva_op on the GPUVA 
space implies that we're not allowed to fail the operation, because 
processing the drm_gpuva_ops directly implies that we can't unwind them 
on failure.

I know that the API functions the documentation guides you to use in 
this case actually can return error codes, but those are just range 
checks. If they fail, it's clearly a bug. However, I did not use WARN() 
for those cases, since the driver could still decide to use the 
callbacks to keep track of the operations in a driver specific way, 
although I would not recommend doing this and rather like to try to 
cover the drivers use case within the regular way of creating a list of 
operations.

Second, most (other) drivers when using the callback way of this 
interface would need to execute the GPUVA space updates asynchronously 
in a dma_fence signalling critical path, where no memory allocations are 
permitted.

Yes, I can definitely add some.
