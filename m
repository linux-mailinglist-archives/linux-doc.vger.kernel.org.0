It is pity that you did not add other printk maintainers into CC for
the patches adding this documentation and comments. I was sick
last two months and was not able to check mails.

Adding them now. Note that the following patch is already in
linux-next, see
https://lore.kernel.org/r/20200403093617.18003-1-ricardo.canuelo@collabora.com

One note about printk-basics.rst. It should mention that pr_*()
variants are preferred over the generic printk(KERN_* ).

Otherwise, I do not see anything critical.


Well, I have mixed feelings about this type of documentation. It might explain
some things that are less obvious, for example, the meaning of
pr_fmt(). On the other hand:

  + It might be complicated to keep it in sync.

  + I wonder how many developers would actually read it.

  + The doc comments in include/linux/prinkt.h are really
    long and describe obvious things.

By other words. These comments make the headers and sources hard to
read. And at least in this particular case, the gain is questionable.

Petr
