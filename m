Some maintainers react strongly to the "this patch" phrasing; better to
use the imperative tense as described in
Documentation/process/submitting-patches.rst.

All of this extra markup does not help, I would not do that.  Functions
are generally marked using the function() convention instead.

This extra markup will actively defeat the automatic markup we already have.
