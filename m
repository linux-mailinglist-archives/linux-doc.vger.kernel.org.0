In my experience, it's common to have several versions of a patch, often
in several threads. If I were to choose which message to reference,
other than the patch that was actually applied, I'd feel it would be a
subjective choice.

I don't think we can reach a meaningful consensus between ourselves that
other people would care about anyway; indeed this sentiment is echoed in
Jon's and Ted's replies.
