These are the generic PHYs used for ethernet, so they are potential
cases for phylink to drive. They were found via:

grep ETHERNET drivers/phy -rl | xargs grep -l power_on



r8a779f0-ether-serdes: r8a779f0_eth_serdes_set_mode() records the
state, returning success, with no hardware programming. All hardware
programming for the desired mode is done via phy_power_on() call.

This driver requires the PHY to be powered down before phy_set_mode*()
otherwise it will accept the new mode but not reconfigure the hardware.


phy-mvebu-cp110-comphy: mvebu_comphy_set_mode() records the state in
struct members and does nothing more, returning success. This
requires the PHY to be powered down before phy_set_mode().

This driver requires the PHY to be powered down before phy_set_mode*()
otherwise it will accept the new mode but not reconfigure the hardware.


phy-mvebu-a3700-comphy: mvebu_a3700_comphy_set_mode() errors out if
mode is changed with PHY powered up:

        /* Mode cannot be changed while the PHY is powered on */
        if (phy->power_count &&
            (lane->mode != mode || lane->submode != submode))
                return -EBUSY;

This driver requires the PHY to be powered down before phy_set_mode*()
otherwise it will error out.


phy-fsl-lynx-28g: lynx_28g_set_mode() powers down the PHY if necessary,
sets the mode, before powering it back up.

This is the only driver that will tolerate phy_power_*() vs
phy_set_mode*() in any order.


phy-qcom-sgmii-eth: doesn't implement phy_set_mode*() but instead
implements phy_set_speed() and phy_calibrate(). phy_set_speed()
sets the mode and immediately calibrates, which presumably requires
the clocks enabled by qcom_dwmac_sgmii_phy_power_on(). No check
for PHY being powered, so my guess is that calling phy_set_speed()
with the PHY powered down will cause the status polling in
qcom_dwmac_sgmii_phy_calibrate() to time out.

This driver requires phy_power_on() before phy_set_speed().


sparx5_serdes: phy_power_*() controls power down mode, no check
in sparx5_serdes_set_mode() whether powered up, but config function
checks for e.g. PLL lock, which probably won't be locked if powered
down. Failures aren't propagated to the API caller.

This driver requires phy_power_on() before phy_set_mode*().


phy-mtk-xfi-tphy: while phy_power_*() controls clocks, it isn't
obvious whether these are required before mtk_xfi_tphy_setup() is
invoked. There are calls to usleep() implying a need to wait for
things to happen before the next register write, which presumably
require the clock to be running.

My guess is, this driver requires phy_power_on() before phy_set_mode*().


Categorisation of drivers:
drivers requiring powered down PHY before phy_set_mode*(), but are
silent if not: 2

drivers requiring powered down PHY before phy_set_mode*(), but error
out if not: 1

drivers that allow any power state before phy_set_mode*(): 1

drivers that do not implement .power_*() methods, allowing any
power state, but presumably require the phy_set_mode*() call to
setup the hardware: 5

drivers requiring powered up PHY before phy_set_mode*(): 3

So, the summary is... only _one_ driver allows the calls in any order.
The other 11 drivers are... stick a pin in the donkey and depending
on where the pin ends up determines the appropriate order that the
generic PHY APIs must be called for the driver to work correctly.

I think you'll agree that this is a very sorry state of affairs.

This is exactly why I think there needs to be better documentation.
I'm not sure that some kind of test code to validate the API would
work, because you'd need some way to test whether the PHY were in a
functional state, and that's difficult without the help of the
ethernet MAC.
