Hi Mauro :)

sure? .. what if the logger wants to log some symbols from the
chines translated parts to stdout and the encoding of stdout is
latin?

In python the logger will raise a UnicodeEncodeError, this is
what I know .. but I'm often wrong ;)

I remember we had some patches to the chinese translation
these days, may be there is an issue the logger wants to report.

    Anyway I would always recommend to use utf-8.

@Michal would you give it a try?
