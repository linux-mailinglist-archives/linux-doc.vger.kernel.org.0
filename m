This sounds good.

Well. For me this sounds like 'we have such capability, no real usecase, 
but we want to support it anyway' kind of story. As history has shown 
multiple times, the order should be the opposite one. First you have the 
use case, then you create the API for it. Otherwise it is very easy to 
end up with the abstraction that looks good on the API side, but is very 
hard to fit into the actual user code.

I would suggest to drop the second bullet for now and focus on getting 
the simple doorbells done and accepted into mainline.
