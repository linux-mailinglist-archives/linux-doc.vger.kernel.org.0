Another reason that I was confused is the conflict of the term.  The term
'pass' at sz_filters_passed stat means passing through the filters checking
stage.  The same term 'pass' at "DAMOS pass filter" means it will let the
memory that matches to its criteria pass the stage.  Hence, the term for
'sz_filters_passed' is a superset of it for 'DAMOS pass filter'.  This is
obviously confusing.

I will rename things that introduced by this series to be called "allow"
instead of "pass" in v2.
