It makes me a bit uneasy to hardcode this into the kernel. It's fairly
specific to qemu/criu, and won't protect usecases that behave slightly
differently.

It would also give userfaultfd users that aren't susceptible to this
particular scenario a different code path.

That's true - although if that happens frequently, it's something we
might want to tune the shrinker for anyway. If subpages do get used
later, we probably shouldn't have split the THP to begin with.

IMO the safest bet would be to use the zero page unconditionally.

It's safe because it's replacing a migration entry. The TLB was
flushed when that was installed, and since the migration pte is not
marked present it couldn't have re-established a TLB entry.
