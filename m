Maybe, yeah - I think it's important to roughly know what they do, but
I would still focus on what rules other parts of MM, or users of MM,
have to follow to not break in their interaction with things like THP
and KSM. So maybe kinda do it in the direction of "these are the rules
(and here is the detail of why we have those arbitrary-looking
rules)"?

Yeah, I agree the pattern you need for the access is not that weird,
it's just weird that you need it for page tables at one specific
level.

Hmm, yeah.
