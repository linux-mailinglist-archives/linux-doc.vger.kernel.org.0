Thanks for working to improve our documentation!

Naturally, I have some comments, the first of which being to run
scripts/get_maintainer.pl on your patches to get the list of people you
should send them to.  Then cut-and-paste it rather then typoing it by
hand :)

This is backward - the changelog goes above the "---" line, any
additional comments go below.

A bulleted list like the above is a good sign that the patch should be
split up - patches should do one thing.

I do not object to these change and could apply this, but it might be
nice at some point to rephrase this stuff so that we don't end up doing
these updates repeatedly.  After all, we'll be at 7.x within a year...

This is a separate change.  But, of course, yesterday's 6.16-rc1 is in
no way a "release candidate".  It's really just the naming scheme that
Linus uses for his testing releases, calling them "release candidates"
muddies the water and risks reigniting old debates.

I almost wonder if the references to Mercurial shouldn't just come out;
I am not aware of anybody using it for kernel work at this point.

I'm also not aware of anybody who has run into trouble because their
distribution lacked a shiny new version of Git.  I'm not sure we want to
encourage people to bug their distributors to accelerate updates?  Is
this paragraph solving a specific problem that you have encountered?

Thanks,

jon
