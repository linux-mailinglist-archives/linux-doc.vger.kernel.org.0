You spotted a flaw in my proposed validation mechanic. As you said,
KVM_SET_MEMORY_ATTRIBUTES2 is a VM-scoped ioctl, meaning we lack the
vCPU context required to safely inspect a specific kvm_run structure.
Attempting to track this state VM-wide in struct kvm_arch would
require introducing a lock on a hot memory-transition path, which we
want to avoid.

Your assessment of the security implications and the TDX fallback
mechanism is correct and applies to pKVM. Because EL2 maintains the
ultimate source of truth regarding Stage-2 permissions, a rogue
conversion by the VMM cannot breach guest confidentiality.

Given this, it makes sense for pKVM will adopt the TDX approach. We
will drop the requirement to synchronously validate the guest's intent
during the ioctl. We will always accept the request in EL1. If the VMM
is lying and the guest never actually authorized the share, the
resulting attribute mismatch will trigger a KVM_EXIT_MEMORY_FAULT upon
the next guest access, or a SIGBUS/SIGSEGV if the host userspace
attempts to map and read the memory. This will DOS/crash the VMM
without endangering the host kernel.

Therefore, kvm_gmem_arch_content_policy_supported() should not be used
for dynamic state-machine validation. We will use it strictly as a
static capability check (e.g., verifying that the requested policy is
architecturally possible).

I think that we would still require gfn and nr_pages in the hook to
allow for potential range-based capability checks in the future, but
not use them to cross-reference pending conversion requests.
