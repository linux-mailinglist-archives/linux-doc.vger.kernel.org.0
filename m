Small nit: true of non-surplus hugetlb pages.

Shouldn't this behavior be possible as an oomd plugin instead, perhaps 
triggered by psi?  I'm not sure if oomd is intended only to kill something 
(oomkilld? lol) or if it can be made to do sysadmin level behavior, such 
as shrinking the hugetlb pool, to solve the oom condition.

If so, it seems like we want to do this at the absolute last minute.  In 
other words, reclaim has failed to free memory by other means so we would 
like to shrink the hugetlb pool.  (It's the reason why it's implemented as 
a predecessor to oom as opposed to part of reclaim in general.)

Do we have the ability to suppress the oom killer until oomd has a chance 
to react in this scenario?
