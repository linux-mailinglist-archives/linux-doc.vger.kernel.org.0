Doing a GUP on an actual shared page is wrong to begin with.

You even know that, you try to use "page_mapcount() > 1" to disallow it.

My point is that it's wrong regardless, and that "mapcount" is
dubious, and that COW cannot - and must not - use mapcount, and that I
think your shared case should strive to avoid it for the exact same
reason.

So, what I think should happen is:

 (a) GUP makes sure that it only ever looks up pages that can be
shared with this VM. This may in involve breaking COW early with any
past fork().

 (b) it marks such pages so that any future work will not cause them
to COW either

Note that (a) is not necessarily "always COW and have to allocate and
copy new page". In particular, if the page is already writable, you
know you already have exclusive access to it and don't need to COW.

And if it isn't writable, then the other common case is "the cow has
only one user, and it's us" - that's the "refcount == 1" case.

And (b) is what we do with that page_maybe_dma_pinned() logic for
fork(), but also for things like swap cache creation (eg see commit
feb889fb40fa: "mm: don't put pinned pages into the swap cache").

Note that this code all already exists, and already works - even
without getting the (very expensive) mmap_sem. So it works with
fast-GUP and it can race with concurrent forking by another thread,
which is why we also have that seqcount thing.

As far as I can tell, your "mapcount" logic fundamentally requires
mmap_sem for the fork() race avoidance, for example.

So this is why I don't like the mapcount games - I think they are very
fragile, and not at all as logical as the two simple rules a/b above.

I believe you can make mapcount games _work_ - we used to have
something like that. It was incredibly fragile, and it had its own set
of bugs, but with enough care it's doable.

But my argument really is that I think it's the wrong approach, and
that we should simply strive to follow the two simple conceptual rules
above.
