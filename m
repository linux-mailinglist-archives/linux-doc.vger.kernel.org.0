Thanks.

No. counter_simple is just for counting when there is no need for
atomicity with the premise that there might be some use-cases. You
are right that this patch series doesn't use these. My hunch is though
that atomic_t is overused and it isn't needed in all cases.

I will do some research to look for any places that can use
counter_simple before I spin v2. If I don't find any, I can drop them.
