I have always thought that the shrinker should play this role in one
way or another. Instead of an arbitrary watermark and asynchronous
work, it incrementally pushes the zswap LRU toward disk as reclaim
activity increases.

Is the point behind proactive shrinking is to reduce the latency in
the reclaim path?
