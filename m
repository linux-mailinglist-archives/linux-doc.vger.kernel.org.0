That's a matter of personal opinion and I disagree with it. There's no
consensus across the kernel docs and I'm using the IEEE style, which is
fairly standard.

I don't want to use a full ReST code reference for that, as that struct
is not really part of the interface for virtio drivers and its
definition is an implementation detail. But I still want to have it
properly formatted in the html and pdf outputs, that's why I'm using
:c:type: there.

I think this is a matter of style as well, maybe a native speaker can
pitch in about the correctness of it.

Cheers,
