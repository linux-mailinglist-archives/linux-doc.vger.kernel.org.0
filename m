Exactly. My point is, don't do this for sysfs mode.
The user can figure this out for sysfs mode, if he/she wanted to (unlike 
the perf mode, where the event could be placed on any CPU). We
don't have to add this fragile change just because the user
don't want to do this himself, when he must know what was used for 
collecting the trace back (again, something the perf mode doesn't have
to worry about and is justifying the use there). In other words, the
change for sysfs mode is not justified enough.
