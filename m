Actually hyperv spec says that currently only two VTLs are implemented in HyperV

https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/hyper-v-on-windows/tlfs/vsm

"Architecturally, up to 16 levels of VTLs are supported; however a hypervisor may choose to implement fewer than 16 VTL’s. Currently, only two VTLs are implemented."

We shouldn't completely hardcode two VTLs but I think that it is safe to make optimizations aiming at two VTLs,
and also have a compile time switch for the number of supported VTLs.

In terms of adding VTLs to MMU role, as long as it's only 2 VTLs, I don't think that this is a terrible idea.

This does bring a question: what we are going to do about SMM? Windows will need it due to secure boot,
so we can't just say that VSM is only supported without SMM.


However if we take the approach of having a VM per VTL, then all of this is free, except that every time userspace changes memslots,
it will have to do so for both VMs at the same time (and that might introduce races).

Also TLB flushes might be tricky to synchronize between these two VMs and so on.
