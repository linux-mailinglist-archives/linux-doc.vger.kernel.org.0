Yeah it was mostly the not being per-cpu I was pointing to in my previous e=

I'm imagining /proc/cpuinfo being closer to "the CPU has it and the
kernel at least vaguely understands it, but may not have full support
for it enabled". I'm assuming /proc/cpuinfo is mostly used by 1)
humans wanting to know if they have hardware support for a feature,
and 2) administrators collecting telemetry to manage fleets (ie do I
have any hardware deployed that supports X). Programmers looking to
see "is the kernel support for this feature ready right now" would
ideally not be parsing /proc/cpuinfo text, as more direct mechanisms
like specific hwprobe bits for "am I fully ready to go" would be
easier to work with. Feel free to yell at me if this overall vision
seems flawed.

I tried to look to see if there was consensus among the other
architectures. Aarch64 seems to go with "supported and fully enabled",
as their cpu_has_feature() directly tests elf_hwcap, and elements in
arm64_elf_hwcaps[] are Kconfig gated. X86 is complicated, but IIRC is
more along the lines of "hardware has it". They have two macros,
cpu_has() for "raw capability" and cpu_feature_enabled() for "kernel
can do it too", and they use cpu_has() for /proc/cpuinfo flags.
