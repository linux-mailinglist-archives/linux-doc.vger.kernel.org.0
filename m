There were some things which made rendered document
look not very elegant. That was because:

1. Numbered lists were formatted in more of Markdown way
   rather than true reStructuredText and so were displayed
   as a plain text with leading numbers.

   Well, moreover numbered lists were not needed as in all cases
   we were just listing a couple of options w/o any intention to
   follow any particular order, so a simpler unordered list fits
   better and looks cleaner.

2. URL's of external resources were added as they are
   (which is OK in a plain text, but make not much sense in
   a HTML where we may use more human-friendly link names
   with URL's hidden.

3. Some URL's had trailing slashes which were not really needed

Fix all items from above!

@@ -52,22 +55,23 @@ Building the Linux kernel for ARC processors
 The process of kernel building for ARC processors is the same as for any other
 architecture and could be done in 2 ways:
 
-1. cross-compilation: process of compiling for ARC targets on a development
-host with a different processor architecture (generally x86_64/amd64).
-
-2. native compilation: process of compiling for ARC on a ARC platform
-(hardware board or a simulator like QEMU) with complete development environment
-(GNU toolchain, dtc, make etc) installed on the platform.

+- Native compilation: process of compiling for ARC on a ARC platform
+  (hardware board or a simulator like QEMU) with complete development environment
+  (GNU toolchain, dtc, make etc) installed on the platform.
 
 In both cases, up-to-date GNU toolchain for ARC for the host is needed.
 Synopsys offers prebuilt toolchain releases which can be used for this purpose,
 available from:
 
-1. Synopsys GNU toolchain releases:
-`<https://github.com/foss-for-synopsys-dwc-arc-processors/toolchain/releases>`_
-2. Linux kernel compilers collection:

 Once the toolchain is installed in the system, make sure its "bin" folder
 is added in your ``PATH`` environment variable. Then set ``ARCH=arc`` &
