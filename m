Yeah this sounds a lot more like a CoC issue (which of course could
result in a very swift removal of commit rights and suspend from all
access to gitlab and mailing lists). Aside from reference the CoC
we've left these things out of scope of the commit rights processes
and merge criteria.

My key takeaway over the last decade more of maintainering is that
assuming that people want to do the right thing and building a process
optimized for that works really well. And then handle the toxic people
entirely separately through solid conduct enforcement.

Yeah I don't see the GDPR connection either.

Yeah, if I don't forget anything I remember a grand total of three
rebases by maintainers, and this over 8 years or so of doing this:

- Someone pushed their entire development tree by accident. We
obviously had to back that out and improved the tooling to catch these
better.
- Someone who pushed an entire pile of work (I think 30 patches or so)
that missed the merge window into -fixes for a late -rc1.
- Someone who lost trust with upstream maintainers because they
refused to listen for way too long to engineering direction and
consensus. The last big push of development work was backed out again.

There might have been some other things, but I think those were more
maintainers screwing things up than committers pushing stuff, and on
trees that are handled with the more classic group maintainer model.

It's really an extremely rare event that we rebase out patches.

Reverts are usually handled like any other patches with the usual test
and review flow, just hopefully a bit accelerated.
