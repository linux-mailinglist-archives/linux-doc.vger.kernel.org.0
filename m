This inspection table could be created in an VMCOREINFO way, the patch
series here[1] is something that would fit it best .

The drawbacks are :
some static variables have to be registered to VMCOREINFO in their file
of residence. This means including vmcoreinfo header and adding
functions/code there, and everywhere that would be needed , or , the
variables have to be un-static'ed , which is a no-go.
This received more negative opinions on that particular patch series.
The annotation idea seemed cleaner and simpler, and more generic.

We could add more and more entries to the vmcoreinfo table, but that
would mean expanding it a lot, which it would maybe defy its purpose,
and be getting too big, especially for the cases where custom drivers
would like to register data.

How I see it, is that maybe the vmcoreinfo init function, could also
parse the inspection table and create more entries if that is needed.
So somehow memory inspection is a superset or generalization , while
VMCOREINFO is a more particular use case that would fit here.

Do you think of some better way to integrate the meminspect table into
VMCOREINFO ?
