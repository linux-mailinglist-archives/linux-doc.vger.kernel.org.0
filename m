Dear Respected Friend,

I am Attasi Dodo, an attorney at law.  I know this might sound somehow
to you because of a lot of activities going on in the world
thesedays.But I assure you that this is real. A deceased client of
mine Mr.Jack Seo, from South Korea who died as the result of a heart
attack in March 12th 2005. His heart sudden demise was due to the
death of all the members of his family in the tsunami disaster on the
26th December 2004 in Sumatra Indonesia.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004_Indian_Ocean_earthquake I have
contacted you to assist in retrieving the estate deposit left behind
by my client in a security company here in Togo before it is
confiscated or declared abandon property  by the said security company
where this deposit valued at Eighteen million dollars (US$18.5 million
dollars) is lodged. This security company has issued me a notice to
contact the next of kin, or the deposit will be confiscated.


My proposition to you is to seek your consent to present you as the
next-of-kin and beneficiary of my late client Mr.Jack Seo, since you
are from the same territory with him, then we can share the money on a
mutually agreed-upon percentage of 50/50%.. All legal documents to
back up your claim as my client's next-of-kin will be provided. All I
require is your honest cooperation to enable us see this transaction
through.This will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will
protect you from any breach of the law.  If this business proposition
offends your moral values, do accept my apology. I must use this
opportunity to implore you to exercise the utmost indulgence to keep
this matter extraordinary confidential, whatever your decision, while
I await your prompt response. Please contact me at once to indicate
your interest. I will like you to acknowledge the receipt of this
e-mail as soon as possible via my PRIVATE EMAIL and treat with
absolute confidentiality and sincerity. I look forward to your quick
reply.

Best regards,
Attasi Dodo
