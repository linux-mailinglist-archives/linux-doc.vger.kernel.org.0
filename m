Hello Carlos,

This is a generational shift.  For my peers, we understand the benefit
of keeping everything in a thread.  But at some point it becomes so
verbose and cumbersome as to defeat the purpose.  The size of the text
I'm working with and the number of text changes it has seen meets that
level.  And so I've kept it in git and referenced that.

1) I'm sending this out to people well outside of the mailing list.
It has gotten around.

2) Ubuntu.  That's why it has an explicit callout.  However, in my
research RHEL does not have this issue.  So I added text calling out
this difference.

3) There is some assumed knowledge.  If a reader doesn't know those
commands, honestly, I don't think it is safe for them to start Kernel
development.  As stated in the preamble, this is targeted towards
upper level CS university students and above.

4) I'm considering changing citations to sources.  It might be more
representative.  There's no specific text taken from them, but there
is knowledge referenced from them used to create  the document which I
did not already possess or, in the case of the VM image, a big ol'
file.
