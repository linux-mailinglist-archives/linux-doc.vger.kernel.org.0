After thinking a little bit more about this, IMHO the best is to have
two separate patches (assuming that there is a good reason why ensuring that the
slot's character is "+"):

This would be patch 1, to overcome some issue (probably due to Python
version) that reading past EOF won't rise an exception. I would very much
want to see what python version you're using and see if some other
exception arose (like EOFError), properly described at the patch description.

This seems to be a separate issue. Why do we need to enforce that the slot data
is "+"? If it doesn't, why this would be a problem?

Btw, reading:

    https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/POSIX-Jobserver.html

We have:

    "In both implementations of the jobserver, the pipe will be pre-loaded with 
     one single-character token for each available job. To obtain an extra slot
     you must read a single character from the jobserver; to release a slot you
     must write a single character back into the jobserver.

     It’s important that when you release the job slot, you write back the same
     character you read. Don’t assume that all tokens are the same character;
     different characters may have different meanings to GNU make. The order is
     not important, since make has no idea in what order jobs will complete anyway."

So, a 100% compliant POSIX jobserver code shall not test for "+", but, instead,
preserve whatever character is there.

Yet, checking for "+" is really needed, please add a rationale at the patch
description justifying why. On such case, we should still:

    - release the slot(s) we don't want by writing the character via
      os.write();
    - print a warning message about why we rejected the slot(s).
