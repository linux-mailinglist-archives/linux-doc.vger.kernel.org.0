Again, it is not the path: it is the "alternatives" - well, except that
Python doesn't use alternatives.

This is on Fedora:

	$ ls -lctra /usr/bin/python???? /usr/bin/python? /usr/bin/python
	-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 11704 ago 21 17:09 /usr/bin/python3.13
	lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root    10 ago 21 17:09 /usr/bin/python3 -> python3.13
	lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root     9 ago 21 17:09 /usr/bin/python -> ./python3
	-rwxr-xr-x 2 root root 11728 ago 21 17:09 /usr/bin/python3.6m
	-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 11704 set  2 16:07 /usr/bin/python3.11
	-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 11704 set  2 16:09 /usr/bin/python3.12
	-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 11712 set  2 16:18 /usr/bin/python3.10

This is on openSuse Leap, after using the procedures recommended
by sphinx-pre-install:

	# ls -l /usr/bin/python*
	lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root     9 Apr  9  2024 /usr/bin/python3 -> python3.6
	-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root  6280 May 18  2024 /usr/bin/python3.11
	-rwxr-xr-x 2 root root 10560 Apr  9  2024 /usr/bin/python3.6
	-rwxr-xr-x 2 root root 10560 Apr  9  2024 /usr/bin/python3.6m

Recommending the user to run:

	# ln -sf python3.11 /usb/bin/python
	# ln -sf python3.11 /usb/bin/python3

Doesn't seem to be right. See below.

Also, adding at .bashrc is not enough, as running "make htmldocs" after
installing the packages will fail except if the user manually runs it.

So, at least for doc build, I still think that getting a python
compatible version is still the better solution - at least for doc
building.

There are very good reasons why not doing that: replacing it
will very likely break the system. If I'm not mistaken, even package
install can break if one does something like that on some distros that
tries to run python at install time and whose scripts may not be 
forward-compatible with newer python versions.

The same problem occurs even if a bash alias would be created and placed
under .bashrc (plus, such procedure assumes shell is bash):

	alias python3=/usr/bin/python3.11

So, if doing something like that won't work, the other alternatives
are:

1. don't use Makefile; instead run:

	python3.11 scripts/tools/sphinx-build-wrapper htmldocs

2. create a <kernel_tree>/bin directory and add there an alias.
   every time you want to build docs, set:

	PATH=<kernel_tree>/bin:$PATH

3. use venv (probably the simplest solution)

the first two are IMHO, a lot more hackish than picking
/usr/bin/python3.11 from the patch where the user already installed
via a distro package and use it.

The third option works, but some developers don't like installing
packages outside the distro-provided package manager.

> Do you know of any other tool that behaves this way?

Not exactly this way. What several other build toolchains do is
to directly download everything that is needed to build (gcc,
make, python, ld, ...) - or to build themselves from the source
before starting building stuff.

Makes sense for kernel-doc.

If it bites, we can deal with it, but see: the alternative is to 
refuse to build the docs and bail out. IMHO, a worse solution(*).

Besides that, we already have since ever things like that, when,
for instance, we check if latexmk is available, falling back
to xelatex if not. The only difference here is that, instead of
requiring a non-python script (or makefile rule), we're handling
with multiple versions of the toolchain directly inside the
python script.

(*) Ok, with the new wrapper tool, he can still build docs by 
prepending "python3.11".

How? I can't see a way to recommend a solution without either
propose a hack or risk breaking the system.
