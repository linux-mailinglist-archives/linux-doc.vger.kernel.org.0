Yes, I fully agree.  Different multiple access check primitives have different
characteristics.

I understand this demonstration shows your AMD IBS-based version of DAMON is
functioning as expected.  Thank you for sharing this!

I didn't read the detailed code of each patch.  But my high level understanding
is as below.

Patches 1 and 2 are needed for supporting loadable module-based DAMON operation
sets (access sampling backend).

Patch 3 is needed for supporting access check primitives that can provide the
access information in only nmi context.  It can also speedup the access
reporting in general, though.

Patch 4 makes DAMON's internal reported access information retrieval faster, so
will help any reporting-based DAMON operation set use case.

Patches 5-7 are required for only the IBS-based DAMON operations set
(paddr_ibs).

So I agree patch 4 is a general infrastructure improvement that benefits
multiple use cases.

Patch 3 is also arguably general infrastructure improvement, as it will make
the reporting faster in general.

Patch 1 is not technically coupled with paddr_ibs, and will be needed for
general loadable module based access check primitives.  But, should we support
lodable modules?  If so, why?

Patch 2 is also not technically coupled with paddr_ibs, to my understanding, so
should be categorized together with patch 1?  In other words, if we agree we
should support lodable modules based DAMON operation sets, this should be
useful for not only paddr_ibs but more general cases.

Correct me if I'm wrong.

So I'm bit unsure about patch 1.  If we don't have a plan to support lodable
modules based DAMON operations set, we might not need it for now.

For patches 3 and 4, I agree those will be useful in general.  Nonetheless, I'd
slightly prefer to do that optimizations at the later part of the long term
project.

So apparently there are multiple approaches to develop and use h/w-based access
monitoring.  Akinobu and you are trying to do that using DAMON as the frontend,
and already made the working prototypes.  There were more people who showed
interest and will to contribute to this project other than you, too.  I 100%
agree h/w-based access monitoring can be useful, and I of course thinking using
DAMON as the fronend is the right approach.  I'm all for making this
upstreamed.

I was therefore spending time on thinking about in what long-term maintainable
shape this capability can successfully be upstreamed.  I suggested
damon_report_access() as the internal interface between DAMON and the h/w-based
access check primitives, and apparently we all (I, Ravi and Akinobu in this
context) agreed.  Akinobu thankfully revisioned his implementation based on
damon_report_access() interface.  Ravi also implemented this RFC based on the
interface.

After making the consensus with Akinobu, I was taking time on the user space
interface.  When I was discussing with Akinobu, my idea was extending the user
interface for the page faults based monitoring v3 [1].  But, recently I decided
to make this more general, so proposed data attributes monitoring extension [2]
at LSFMMBPF.  The patch series for the initial change [3] is merged into mm-new
for more testing, today.  The cover letter of the patch series is also sharing
how it will be extended for h/w based access monitoring in long term.

I of course want us to go in this direction.  I believe you already had chances
to take a look on the long term plan and didn't make some voice because you
don't strongly disagree about the plan.  If not, please make a voice.

Assuming you don't have concern on the long term plan yet, I will take time to
write down more formal and detailed plan.  It will explain the overall roadmap,
timeline and how we could collaborate.  On top of that, we could further
discuss.

I'm still thinking about how we can collaborate well.  The answer for the above
question would be a part of that.  In other words, I have no good answer right
now, sorry.  Could you please give me more time to think more and share the
plan?  I will share the plan as another mail.  On the thread, we could further
discuss.  Of course, we could have DAMON beer/coffee/tea chats [4] like
additional discussions before/after/during the plan discussion.

So, long story short, we agreed this project (h/w-based data access monitoring)
should be upstreamed.  But give me little more time on thinking about how we
will do it and collaborate.  It will take some time.  Please bear in mind.
Sorry for making you wait, but I pretty sure and promise that we will
eventually make it.
