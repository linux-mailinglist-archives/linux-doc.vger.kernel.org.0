May be we have a different view on this, for me an application which
reads UTF-8 in and spids out UTF-8 is an UTF-8 application.

hint: HTML is just one Sphinx writer, there exist also other writers
e.g. LaTeX.

This is your POV, the python developers have a different view on
handling strings.  There are epic discussions around about.

But all this discussions won't help, since we can't change the
principles of python.

Personally I think I can't ignore the principles of a language
and I'm feeling well with setting up an UTF-8 environment.

For me "i18n translated message" is a good example that I'm not
wrong with my opinions.  This is not true for all devices but
on those device you won't run an applications like Sphinx.

Sorry, I have spoken about common LXC images.

I guess these days most often they will use UTF-8 since ASCII
haven't helped in the past 80s ;-)
