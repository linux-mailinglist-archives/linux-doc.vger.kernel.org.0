A little more detail here:

 - Zone/Node/Section stay in page->flags and are replicated to
   folio->flags
 - HWPoison stays in page->flags
 - Reserved stays in page->flags
 - AnonExclusive stays in page->flags
 - Writeback/Referenced/Uptodate/Dirty/LRU/Active/Workingset/Owner1/
   Owner2/Reclaim/Swapbacked/Unevictable/Dropbehind/MLocked/Young/Idle
   all exist only in folio->flags
 - Head/Private/Private2 all go away
 - Locked & Waiters are ... complicated.  I'll elaborate if there's
   demand.
 - I haven't put any effort into analyzing the Xen flags.
 - HasHWPoisoned/LargeRmappable/PartiallyMapped all move to folio->flags

ptdesc, yes.  Slab is still in progress.

What I'm hoping to get to is a point where calling compound_head() on
a page which is part of a folio is a BUG.  You should only be calling
page_folio() on a page which is part of a folio -- because there's nothing
useful to find in the head page.  So compound_head (or compound_info) can
share space with page->memdesc.  For now I've actually put page->memdesc
adjacent to page->compound_head, for no reason that I can recall.

I had thought that calling page_folio() on a page that's not part of
a folio would also be a BUG(), but now I think it's better to quietly
return NULL.  That's based on my experience working with slab and ptdesc.
