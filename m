I think we should find a place for this kind of information, but I don't
think submitting-patches.rst is it.  That's meant to be a comprehensive set
of rules and guidelines; it's already far too long as it is.  A separate
document with introductory tutorials might be a good idea.

What's "not too old"?  A reader who needs documentation at this level will
not have an answer to that question.

This, too, will not be helpful to somebody needing this kind of
documentation.  We should actually tell them how to do this configuration.

This is a start, but many readers at this level won't really know what this
means.

Examples are good for this kind of thing.

Also, watch your line lengths; there's no reason to go over 80 columns for
this kind of text.  You tell people to run checkpatch but didn't do it :)

So much of this would work better with an example.

"hopefully"?

Honestly, you probably want to test your changes before you start
committing things and writing changelogs.

...again...  why would you commit untested changes?

Normally one adds the signoff when committing.

This is late to be sure you have your changelog formatted correctly.

It can be good advice to tell people to ensure that the patch can be
applied.  git send-email shouldn't corrupt patches, though.

Thanks for working to improve our documentation!  I think there can be
value in something like this, once it gets into shape.
