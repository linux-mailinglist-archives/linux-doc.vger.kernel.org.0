The fixes seemed correct on my review, what was wrong with them?  And
having the code fixed for known issues is a good thing here, it gives
the gpio people a base to test their work on.

As no one is currently using this, I will disable this from the build,
but keeping the code in the tree right now is a good thing as I do feel
this is the right way forward, and others can work off of it easier this
way.
