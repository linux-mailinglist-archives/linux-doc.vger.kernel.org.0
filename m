[sorry, once again I have to sent it a second time, as vger rejected it;
thunderbird once again messed for some reason used
"Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit" then it should have used 8bit; I tried
to track this down by sending mails to myself, but then it sets 8bit
correctly when needed :-/ ]

Well, that is already explained in
Documentation/maintainer/configure-git.rst afaics -- which is the better
place afaics, as that is something maintainers should do, and not
something people should do when submitting a patch.

Ciao, Thorsten
