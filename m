Some thoughts on hardware that is used for real-time workload. Certainly
not complete but should cover some of the import topics such as:

- Main memory, caches and the possiblie control given by the hardware.
- What could happen by putting critical hardware behind USB or VirtIO.
- Allowing real-time tasks to consume the CPU entirely without giving
  the system some time to breath.
- Networking with what the kernel provides.

+
+The way a workload is handled can be influenced by the hardware it runs on.
+Key components include the CPU, memory, and the buses that connect them.
+These resources are shared among all applications on the system.
+As a result, heavy utilization of one resource by a single application
+can affect the deterministic handling of workloads in other applications.
+
+Below is a brief overview.
+
+System memory and cache
+-----------------------
+
+Main memory and the associated caches are the most common shared resources=
 among
+tasks in a system. One task can dominate the available caches, forcing ano=
ther
+task to wait until a cache line is written back to main memory before it c=
an
+proceed. The impact of this contention varies based on write patterns and =
the
+size of the caches available. Larger caches may reduce stalls because more=
 lines
+can be buffered before being written back. Conversely, certain write patte=
rns
+may trigger the cache controller to flush many lines at once, causing
+applications to stall until the operation completes.
+
+This issue can be partly mitigated if applications do not share the same C=
PU
+cache. The kernel is aware of the cache topology and exports this informat=
ion to
+user space. Tools such as **lstopo** from the Portable Hardware Locality (=
hwloc)
+project (https://www.open-mpi.org/projects/hwloc/) can visualize the hiera=
rchy.
+
+Avoiding shared L2 or L3 caches is not always possible. Even when cache sh=
aring
+is minimized, bottlenecks can still occur when accessing system memory. Me=
mory
+is used not only by the CPU but also by peripheral devices via DMA, such as
+graphics cards or network adapters.
+
+In some cases, cache and memory bottlenecks can be controlled if the hardw=
are
+provides the necessary support. On x86 systems, Intel offers Cache Allocat=
ion
+Technology (CAT), which enables cache partitioning among applications and
+provides control over the interconnect. AMD provides similar functionality=
 under
+Platform Quality of Service (PQoS). On Arm64, the equivalent is Memory
+System Resource Partitioning and Monitoring (MPAM).
+
+These features can be configured through the Linux Resource Control interf=
ace.
+For details, see Documentation/filesystems/resctrl.rst.
+
+The perf tool can be used to monitor cache behavior. It can analyze
+cache misses of an application and compare how they change under
+different workloads on a neighboring CPU. Even more powerful, the perf
+c2c tool can help identify cache-to-cache issues, where multiple CPU
+cores repeatedly access and modify data on the same cache line.
+
+Hardware busses
+---------------
+
+Real-time systems often need to access hardware directly to perform their =
work.
+Any latency in this process is undesirable, as it can affect the outcome o=
f the
+task. For example, on an I/O bus, a changed output may not become immediat=
ely
+visible but instead appear with variable delay depending on the latency of=
 the
+bus used for communication.
+
+A bus such as PCI is relatively simple because register accesses are routed
+directly to the connected device. In the worst case, a read operation stal=
ls the
+CPU until the device responds.
+
+A bus such as USB is more complex, involving multiple layers. A register r=
ead
+or write is wrapped in a USB Request Block (URB), which is then sent by the
+USB host controller to the device. Timing and latency are influenced by the
+underlying USB bus. Requests cannot be sent immediately; they must align w=
ith
+the next frame boundary according to the endpoint type and the host contro=
ller's
+scheduling rules. This can introduce delays and additional latency. For ex=
ample,
+a network device connected via USB may still deliver sufficient throughput=
, but
+the added latency when sending or receiving packets may fail to meet the
+requirements of certain real-time use cases.
+
+Additional restrictions on bus latency can arise from power management. For
+instance, PCIe with Active State Power Management (ASPM) enabled can suspe=
nd
+the link between the device and the host. While this behavior is beneficia=
l for
+power savings, it delays device access and adds latency to responses. This=
 issue
+is not limited to PCIe; internal buses within a System-on-Chip (SoC) can a=
lso be
+affected by power management mechanisms.
+
+Virtualization
+--------------
+
+In a virtualized environment such as KVM, each guest CPU is represented as=
 a
+thread on the host. If such a thread runs with real-time priority, the sys=
tem
+should be tested to confirm it can sustain this behavior over extended per=
iods.
+Because of its priority, the thread will not be preempted by lower-priority
+threads (such as SCHED_OTHER), which may then receive no CPU time. This can
+cause problems if a lower-priority thread is pinned to a CPU already occup=
ied by
+a real-time task and unable to make progress. Even if a CPU has been isola=
ted,
+the system may still (accidentally) start a per=E2=80=91CPU thread on that=
 CPU.
+Ensuring that a guest CPU goes idle is difficult, as it requires avoiding =
both
+task scheduling and interrupt handling. Furthermore, if the guest CPU does=
 go
+idle but the guest system is booted with the option **idle=3Dpoll**, the g=
uest
+CPU will never enter an idle state and will instead spin until an event
+arrives.
+
+Device handling introduces additional considerations. Emulated PCI devices=
 or
+VirtIO devices require a counterpart on the host to complete requests. This
+adds latency because the host must intercept and either process the request
+directly or schedule a thread for its completion. These delays can be avoi=
ded if
+the required PCI device is passed directly through to the guest. Some devi=
ces,
+such as networking or storage controllers, support the PCIe SR-IOV feature.
+SR-IOV allows a single PCIe device to be divided into multiple virtual fun=
ctions,
+which can then be assigned to different guests.
+
+Networking
+----------
+
+For low-latency networking, the full networking stack may be undesirable, =
as it
+can introduce additional sources of delay. In this context, XDP can be used
+as a shortcut to bypass much of the stack while still relying on the kerne=
l's
+network driver.
+
+The requirements are that the network driver must support XDP- preferably =
using
+an "skb pool" and that the application must use an XDP socket. Additional
+configuration may involve BPF filters, tuning networking queues, or config=
uring
+qdiscs for time-based transmission. These techniques are often
+applied in Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) environments.
+
+Documenting all required steps exceeds the scope of this text. For detailed
+guidance, see the TSN documentation at https://tsn.readthedocs.io.
+
+Another useful resource is the Linux Real-Time Communication Testbench
+https://github.com/Linutronix/RTC-Testbench.
+The goal of this project is to validate real-time network communication. I=
t can
+be thought of as a "cyclictest" for networking and also serves as a starti=
ng
+point for application development.
