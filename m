Yeah sorry I wrote two contradictory things above, that's what I meant too.

I don't have it, but should be fairly simple I guess. I just wanted to
keep it simple for now.

Anyhow someone needs to first test the current patchset to get some
numbers, we would be wasting time on this if no one gets an improvement.
