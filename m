Maybe s/doing/committing/ if you want to use KMS terms.

The second part sounds weird. I'd write

"while object states are allocated when preparing the update and kept
alive as long as they are active in the hardware."

or something similar. Writing "device" instead of "hardware" could also
be better.

The first part doesn't use first person pronouns, you may want to be
consistent across the whole text and use a descriptive style here too.

Yes, it's not very clear. The text should describe whether the
drm_atomic_state just points to the active state of the entities, or
duplicates them. "copy the state" is ambiguous.

Technically you're freeing the "existing" state per your nomenclature
above, which points to the old state. The word "existing" seems to make
things harder to describe, there may be an opportunity for better
vocabulary.

It's certainly a useful addition to the documentation.
