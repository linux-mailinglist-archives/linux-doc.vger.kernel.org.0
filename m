Subject: [PATCH v3 1/1] sched/fair: Fix low cpu usage with high throttling by removing expiration of cpu-local slices

It has been observed, that highly-threaded, non-cpu-bound applications
running under cpu.cfs_quota_us constraints can hit a high percentage of
periods throttled while simultaneously not consuming the allocated
amount of quota.  This use case is typical of user-interactive non-cpu
bound applications, such as those running in kubernetes or mesos when
run on multiple cpu cores.

This has been root caused to threads being allocated per cpu bandwidth
slices, and then not fully using that slice within the period. At which
point the slice and quota expires.  This expiration of unused slice
results in applications not being able to utilize the quota for which
they are allocated.

The expiration of per-cpu slices was recently fixed by
'commit 512ac999d275 ("sched/fair: Fix bandwidth timer clock drift
condition")'.  Prior to that it appears that this has been broken since
at least 'commit 51f2176d74ac ("sched/fair: Fix unlocked reads of some
cfs_b->quota/period")' which was introduced in v3.16-rc1 in 2014.  That
added the following conditional which resulted in slices never being
expired.

if (cfs_rq->runtime_expires != cfs_b->runtime_expires) {
	/* extend local deadline, drift is bounded above by 2 ticks */
	cfs_rq->runtime_expires += TICK_NSEC;

Because this was broken for nearly 5 years, and has recently been fixed
and is now being noticed by many users running kubernetes
(https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/67577) it is my opinion
that the mechanisms around expiring runtime should be removed
altogether.

This allows only per-cpu slices to live longer than the period boundary.
This allows threads on runqueues that do not use much CPU to continue to
use their remaining slice over a longer period of time than
cpu.cfs_period_us. However, this helps prevents the above condition of
hitting throttling while also not fully utilizing your cpu quota.

This theoretically allows a machine to use slightly more than it's
allotted quota in some periods.  This overflow would be bounded by the
remaining per-cpu slice that was left un-used in the previous period.
For CPU bound tasks this will change nothing, as they should
theoretically fully utilize all of their quota and slices in each
period. For user-interactive tasks as described above this provides a
much better user/application experience as their cpu utilization will
more closely match the amount they requested when they hit throttling.

This greatly improves performance of high-thread-count, non-cpu bound
applications with low cfs_quota_us allocation on high-core-count
machines. In the case of an artificial testcase, this performance
discrepancy has been observed to be almost 30x performance improvement,
while still maintaining correct cpu quota restrictions albeit over
longer time intervals than cpu.cfs_period_us.  That testcase is
available at https://github.com/indeedeng/fibtest.

+Real-world behavior of slice non-expiration
+-------------------------------------------
+The fact that cpu-local slices do not expire results in some interesting corner
+cases that should be understood.
+
+For cgroup cpu constrained applications that are cpu limited this is a
+relatively moot point because they will naturally consume the entirety of their
+quota as well as the entirety of each cpu-local slice in each period.  As a
+result it is expected that nr_periods roughly equal nr_throttled, and that
+cpuacct.usage will increase roughly equal to cfs_quota_us in each period.
+
+However in a worst-case scenario, highly-threaded, interactive/non-cpu bound
+applications this non-expiration nuance allows applications to briefly burst
+past their quota limits by the amount of unused slice on each cpu that the task
+group is running on.  This slight burst requires that quota had been assigned
+and then not fully used in previous periods.  This burst amount will not be
+transferred between cores.  As a result, this mechanism still strictly limits
+the task group to quota average usage, albeit over a longer time window than
+period.  This provides better more predictable user experience for highly
+threaded applications with small quota limits on high core count machines.  It
+also eliminates the propensity to throttle these applications while
+simultanously using less than quota amounts of cpu.  Another way to say this,
+is that by allowing the unused portion of a slice to remain valid across
+periods we have decreased the possibility of wasting quota on cpu-local silos
+that don't need a full slice's amount of cpu time.
+
+The interaction between cpu-bound and non-cpu-bound-interactive applications
+should also be considered, especially when single core usage hits 100%.  If you
+gave each of these applications half of a cpu-core and they both got scheduled
+on the same CPU it is theoretically possible that the non-cpu bound application
+will use up to sched_cfs_bandwidth_slice_us additional quota in some periods,
+thereby preventing the cpu-bound application from fully using it's quota by
+that same amount.  In these instances it will be up to the CFS algorithm (see
+sched-design-CFS.txt) to decide which application is chosen to run, as they
+will both be runnable and have remaining quota.  This runtime discrepancy will
+should made up in the following periods when the interactive application idles.
