You're right, and I want to walk back the "artificial EM doesn't need
this" framing entirely -- it doesn't survive your example. What I want
to argue instead is narrower: that even though intel_pstate active
mode tracks demand much more weakly than schedutil, the specific
conclusion this simplified EM's cost ranking relies on (E-cores cost
less than P-cores at matched conditions) still holds up against
measured energy, and that's a different, more modest claim than "OPP
tracks utilization closely enough for per-bin accuracy."

I measured the actual frequency behavior on this test machine (one
P-core, one E-core, isolated, stress-ng --cpu-load duty cycles at
20/40/60/80/100%, turbostat Bzy_MHz =3D average frequency only during
the busy portion of each cycle) under three regimes:

                    20%    40%    60%    80%   100%   span
  passive+schedutil  P    2523   2879   3786   4537   4567  2044
                      E    2335   2416   2574   3070   3399  1064
  active EPP=3Dbalance  P   2225   2285   2497   2646   2778   553
                      E   2101   2215   2375   2462   2555   454
  active EPP=3Dperf     P   4483   4519   4496   4537   4564    81
                      E   3364   3377   3380   3387   3399    35

It is visible now that intel_pstate active
mode does *not* track demand anywhere near as tightly as schedutil,
and i don't think that claim survives scrutiny, dropping it.

What does survive, I think, is narrower: E-cores measured consistently
cheaper per unit of completed work than P-cores, across every matched-
parallelism configuration I tested (data below), regardless of which
exact OPP HWP autonomously picked underneath. I don't have data on
idle-state residency to know truly whether the race-to-idle behavior under
EPP=3Dperformance recovers any of that gap through deeper C-states --
that's an open question I haven't tested.

  1 core alone:          P 7.27 J/unit   E 6.25 J/unit   (P +16%)
  1 core, packed x2:     P 7.24 J/unit   E 6.13 J/unit   (P +18%)
  2 cores, spread:       P 4.84 J/unit   E 3.82 J/unit   (P +27%)

P consistently costs more than E for the same completed work at every
matched parallelism level I tried. Separately, I also measured that
spreading work across more E-cores is itself far more efficient than
packing it onto fewer (8 E-cores spread: 1.74 J/unit vs the same total
work packed onto 1 E-core: 6.10 J/unit. In fact, this is the most
efficient placement --
even better than global spreading) -- I also have traced
find_energy_efficient_cpu()
produced spread placement in practice under this patch with real tasks,
and it roughly does follow this heavy preference for E cores during light l=
oad.
Note: P cores occasionally seem to spike, likely due to misfit tasks
which are larger
than E core capacity when nosmt=3Dforce is active  (512). To place E
cores capacities
at half of P cores' feels weird, as the vast majority of workloads enjoy on=
ly a
40-60% performance disparity between them both (the outliers observed are
mostly float point heavy tasks, software ipc class 2).

Given the data above, I don't think I can honestly word that
declaration as "as good as schedutil" -- it isn't, by a factor of
2-25x depending on EPP. If a flag like this still makes sense, I'd
want its justification to say something narrower: "this driver's
internal governor, combined with this EM's coarse type-based ranking,
still produces correct placement decisions in practice" rather than
claiming OPP-tracking parity. I'm not sure if that's a distinction
that belongs in the flag's contract itself, or just in this
patch's commit message -- happy to go either way, or to test more
if that would help decide.

That's fair. I will be updating the code to ignore cpus with no perf
domain. I also want to discuss whether or not is it worth it to
aggregate E clusters inside the same perf domain, as they share the
same L2 cache and
migrations are likely easier.

No additional sync besides what is already in use today. In fact, this
very pointer is dereferenced the same way in other paths of the
kernel.
