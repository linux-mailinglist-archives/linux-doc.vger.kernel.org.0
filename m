Yeah it looks good too.  It's just to avoid starting with "pfn_" I guess, so at
least we know that's something related to swap not one specific pfn.

I found the naming is important as e.g. in my series I introduced another idea
called "swap special pte" or "special swap pte" (yeah so indeed my naming is
not that coherent as well... :), then I noticed if without a good naming I'm
afraid we can get lost easier.

I have a description here in the commit message re the new swap special pte:

https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20210427161317.50682-5-peterx@redhat.com/

In which the uffd-wp marker pte will be the first swap special pte.  Feel free
to ignore the details too, just want to mention some context, while it should
be orthogonal to this series.

I think yet-another swap entry suites for my case too but it'll be a waste as
in that pte I don't need to keep pfn information, but only a marker (one single
bit would suffice), so I chose one single pte value (one for each arch, I only
defined that on x86 in my series which is a special pte with only one bit set)
to not pollute the swap entry address spaces.

I'll leave the decision to you, especially in case you still prefer the old
naming.  Or feel free to wait too until someone else shares the thoughts so as
to avoid unnecessary rebase work.
