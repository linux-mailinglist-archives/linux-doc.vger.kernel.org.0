Quite frankly, have you tried to read the latest reports ? They're full
of "**" everywhere with no spacing nor indent at all, it's particularly
hard to find the relevant information in them. It's super tempting to
copy-paste them to the plenty of online viewers to render them correctly,
except we'd rather not do that for obvious reasons. And when you start
to discuss it gets even worse with ``` formating tags isolated between
quoted paragraphs and no longer being relevant.

And let's be honest, these ones are close to 100% of the time generated
by AI tools which are almost unable to produce anything else anymore by
default because that's what they're using to interact with the chatbot's
UI. If at least that forces those seeking a CVE number to actually *read*
what their favorite AI bot produced, it will be a huge gain for everyone.
Right now I'm really ashamed to forward AI-generated garbage to subsystem
maintainers just in case there would be anything valid despite the format
already strongly hinting otherwise.

IMHO we don't want useless nor hard-to-exploit reports in the first
place, and to date I don't remember seeing a really valid and
immediately actionable one using such decorations, since they were
not written by the reporters.
