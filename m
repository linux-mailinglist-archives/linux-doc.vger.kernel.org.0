This is a scheduler abstraction value from 0-1024. Biggest CPU always has
a capacity of 1024. On SMP all cpus appear as 1024 CPUs.

This has my Arm SoB :-)

This was added based on Lukasz comments. Both Lukasz and Dietmar were my
colleagues at Arm and are on CC.

I don't think it was necessary to expand the recipients list. But probably more
is better though all the scheduler people are covered. This has nothing to do
with Arm but it's the prime example of heterogeneous systems.

All of these were added based on Lukasz review comments. He thought they're
important pieces and should be highlighted, I opted to do that by making them
bold text.


Thanks!
