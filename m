The problem is that in majority of cases where we have explicit heading
in .rst file, the same name is used as DOC: title. If we unconditionally
add target for every DOC: title, then Sphinx will complain with:

"WARNING: Duplicate target name, cannot be used as a unique reference"

and render documentation with non-working cross references.

AFAIK, this patch as-is does not introduce any new warning.

Thanks,
Michal
