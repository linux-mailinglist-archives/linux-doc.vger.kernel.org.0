Yeah, feel free to do what fits best with regards to this one.

If you prefer to merge it instead, I'm enclosing the last version of it,
with that quick hack I just wrote, plus the change of the toctree for
it to produce the 2-level index.

[PATCH] tools: memory-model: add it to the Documentation body

The books at tools/memory-model/Documentation are very well
formatted. Congrats to the ones that wrote them!

The manual conversion to ReST is really trivial:

	- Add document titles;
	- change the bullets on some lists;
	- mark code blocks.
