I am a little bit confused about this. Why do we only need to query the
device before migrating the page?

Are we checking if the device has enough memory for the worst case
scenario (i.e. PAGE_SIZE)?

Or are we checking if the device can compress this specific page and
checking if it can compress it and store it? This seems like it could be
racy and there might be some throwaway work.

I guess my question is: why not just give the page to the device and get
either: successfully compressed and stored OR failed?

Another question, can the device or driver be configured such that we
reject pages that compress poorly to avoid wasting memory and BW on the
device for little savings?

This makes sense. I am assuming the main benefit of zswap.c over cram.c
in this scenario is limiting read accesses as well.

Yeah I didn't necessarily mean CXL code, but whatever layer is
responsible for keeping track of which nodes can be used for what.

This part needs more thought. Zswap cannot charge a full page because
then from the memcg perspective reclaim is not making any progress.
OTOH, as you mention, from the system perspective we just consumed a
full page, so not charging that would be inconsistent.

This is not a zswap-specific thing though, even with cram.c we have to
figure out how to charge memory on the compressed node to the memcg.
It's perhaps not as much of a problem as with zswap because we are not
dealing with reclaim not making progress.

Maybe the memcg limits need to be "enlightened" about different tiers?
We did have such discussions in the past outside the context of
compressed memory, for memory tiering in general.

Not sure if this is the right place to discuss this, but I see the memcg
folks CC'd so maybe it is :)

Yeah probably the easiest way to deal with this, assuming we keep
entry->length as PAGE_SIZE.

This is similar-ish to the memcg charging problem, how do we count the
compressed memory usage toward the global zswap limit? Do we keep this
limit for the top-tier? If not, do we charge full size for pages in
c.zswap or compressed size?

Do we need a separate limit for c.zswap? Probably not if the whole node
is dedicated for zswap usage.

Not a big deal. An RFC or HACK or whatever tag just usually helps signal
to everyone (and more importantly, to Andrew) that this should not be
merged as-is.
