No matter what you write, between your text and their boss's directive,
I bet the latter will be a lot more effective.

No, that's the case where you can still "fix" maintainer's behaviors.

It seems unavoidable that internal patches have higher priorities even
if the maintainer is not overloaded.

Even on a perfect world, the degree of confidence on internal patches is 
usually orders of magnitude higher, as internal devs have access to internal
product documentation, future line of products that will re-use the same
driver and, on larger projects, will also be already tested by internal
CI-based regression tests.

The external patches won't have that, so they need to be reviewed by
an internal developer, checked against internal docs and then submitted to 
the company's internal CI regression test infra to achieve the same degree
of confidence.

That not to mention that company will almost always prioritize new
product support over maintaining existing products.

No do/don't kind of document will change that.

A change like that should come top/down, so it has to be addressed 
via other strategies, like documents underlining the benefits of 
upstream first, and tutorials/speeches aimed at companies management
staff.

Thanks,
Mauro
