Not how things work. The driver may try to avoid some really
expensive operations, but generally it will just blindly blast
the full state to the hardware.

IIRC this was discussed long ago when atomic was being designed
and the general concensus was that the kernel shouldn't generally
do this kind of stuff, and instead we just leave it to userspace
to generate optimal commits.

Safe but not optimal. Any object included in the state will cause said
object to be part of the commit, and side effects will also need to be
observed.

So if you add an extra crtc (either directly or indirectly) it will
have a new commit inserted into the queue and thus and any subsequent
commit will either block or be rejected with -EBUSY. Also for directly
added crtcs an event will be emitted once the commit is done.

Any plane added will also need to observe side effects even if the FB
doesn't change, such as invalidating any internal compressed version
of the old FB contents, PSR/DSI command mode/etc. will need to upload
the frame to the display, etc. I suppose we could specify that if no
FB is specified at all then these kind of side effects could be ignored,
but that is certainly not how things are implemented right now.

So for optimal behaviour userspace should be minimizing the commits.
