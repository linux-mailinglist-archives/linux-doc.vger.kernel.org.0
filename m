Yes, use-after-free and reuse-while-freeing are the two challenges AFAIKs.

Three additions as far as I can tell:

1. Fully locked currently needs the read mmap lock OR the rmap lock in
   read. PTLs on their own are not sufficient AFAIKT.
2. #1 and #2 can currently only walk within VMA ranges.
3. We can theoretically walk page tables outside VMA ranges with the
write mmap lock, because page tables get removed with the mmap lock in
read mode and heavy-weight operations (VMA layout, khugepaged) are
performed under the write mmap lock.

The rmap locks protect from modifications where we want to exclude rmap
walkers similarly to how we grab the mmap lock in write, where the PTLs
are not sufficient.

See mm/mremap.c:move_ptes() as an example which performs VMA layout +
page table modifications. See khugepagd which doesn't perform VMA layout
modifications but page table modifications.

When you talk about PTLs, do you mean only PTE-PTLs or also PMD-PTLs?

Because the PMD-PTLs re usually not taken in case we know there is a
page table (nothing would currently change it without heavy locking).
And if they are taken, they are only held while allocating/checking a
PMDE, not while actually *using* the page table that's mapped in that entry.

For example, walk_page_range() requires the mmap lock in read and grabs
the PTE-PTLs.

It would still be a fairly coarse-grained locking, I am not sure if that
is a step into the right direction. If you want to modify *some* page
table in your process you have exclude each and every page table walker.
Or did I mis-interpret what you were saying?

I looked into such a lock recently in similar context and something like
that does not exist yet (and fairness will be challenging). You either
have a single reader or multiple writer. I'd be interested if someone
knows of something like that.
