Err, why did the check exist to begin with? If the check isn't wanted,
that's one thing, but I was just trying to fix what I saw in the redzone
handling. What is preferred here?

1) drop patch 2
2) keep patch 2, but also:
	a) validate slab/slob can handle < word-sized allocations
	b) remove check in kmem_cache_sanity_check

option 2a seems like it could be fragile if I miss something. I think
I'd rather just take option 1.
