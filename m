Understood.  As mentioned in my previous email, I'll update the selftests to
reflect this.  The test case somehow is simplified to setup the scenario it
wants to test.

You're right that cros_ec_chardev.c needs to be adjusted before using the
version of revocable.

I'm not sure if I understand you: as we're discussing about the stale pointer
of revocable provider consumers might cache here, do you mean it doesn't need
RCU at all to protect the race you reported in
https://lore.kernel.org/all/aXdy-b3GOJkzGqYo@hovoldconsulting.com/?

The reference count in struct revocable_provider can't protect the race
reported https://lore.kernel.org/all/aXdy-b3GOJkzGqYo@hovoldconsulting.com/.

Probably no, struct revocable is for consumer handle.  It needs somewhere to
store the SRCU index.

No, without the RCU, it can't prevent the race between revoking and creating
a new consumer handle.
