It's no workaround. The fundamental problem is that drivers can become
unbound at any time, and we cannot make consumers drop their references.
Every subsystem must deal with this reality, or suffer from
user-after-free bugs. See [1-3] for discussion of this problem in
relation to PCSs and PHYs, and [4] for more discussion of my approach.

And what happens when the driver is unbound from the device and suddenly
a PCS on that list is free'd memory but is in active use by a netdev?

I agree that a "cells" approach would require this, but

- There are no in-tree examples of where this is necessary
- I think this would be easy to add when necessary

Unfortunately, this is required by the kernel driver model :l

Thanks. One of my peeves is subsystems that have zero docs...
