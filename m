Diagram explanation text is supposed to be interleaved commentary
between diagram parts that are spread out, but it outputs ugly in
htmldocs due to trailing vertices as if both the explanation and the
diagram are in the same literal code block.

Trim trailing vertices.

+Associated with the new var ref field are a couple of new hist_field
+members, var.hist_data and var_ref_idx.  For a variable reference, the
+var.hist_data goes with the var.idx, which together uniquely identify
+a particular variable on a particular histogram.  The var_ref_idx is
+just the index into the var_ref_vals[] array that caches the values of
+each variable whenever a hist trigger is updated.  Those resulting
+values are then finally accessed by other code such as trace action
+code that uses the var_ref_idx values to assign param values.
