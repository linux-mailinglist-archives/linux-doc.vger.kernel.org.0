Hi Andrew

FWFT is not really meant to "query" information from the firmware,
fwft_set() wouldn't have anything to actually set. The problem would
also just be pushed away from Linux but would probably still require
specification anyway.

My preferred option would have been option 2. BTW, what are the
arguments to push away the description of misaligned access speed out of
device-tree ? that's almost exactly what the device-tree is meant to do,
ie describe hardware.

As a last resort solution, I'm for option 3. There already exists a
command line option to preset the jiffies. This is almost the same use
case that we have, ie have a faster boot time by presetting the
misaligned access probing.

IMHO, skipping misaligned access probing speed is orthogonal to
EFFICIENT_UNALIGNED_ACCESS. one is done at runtime and allows the
userspace to know the speed of misaligned accesses, the other one at
compile time to improve kernel speed. Depending on which system we want
to support, we might need to enable EFFICIENT_UNALIGNED_ACCESS as a
default, allowing for the most Linux "capable" chips to have full
performances.
