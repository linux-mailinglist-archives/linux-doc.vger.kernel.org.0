Still, as far as upstream is concerned this is damn near a decade old.
Decisions that you or your peers made in the downstream doesn't change
that.

The appropriate time to ask for accomodation was a *very* long time ago.

And in the absence of clear evidence of a guest depending on the broken
IGROUPR behavior, I don't see how the guest-side changes of Christoffer's
series are any different from the multitude of bug fixes that we take
every single release cycle. It is an unfortunate bug and I concur with
Marc that it doesn't seem like the sort of thing a guest could rely
upon.

Because it is very much a bug fix, it should've happened without a
change to the revision number.

Now, the handling of GICD_IIDR itself is a separate issue. By my count,
the series broke UAPI on three separate occasions. Before b489edc36169
IIDR was RAZ/WI from userspace. And of course dd6251e463d3 and d53c2c29ae0d
changed the revision with no way of restoring the old value.

And really, IIDR should've *never* been used as a buy in for new UAPI
because it unnecessarily becomes guest visible. 49a1a2c70a7f ("KVM: arm64:
vgic-v3: Advertise GICR_CTLR.{IR, CES} as a new GICD_IIDR revision") is
a much better example for IIDR going forward as it gates *guest-side*
behavior.

Wrong or not, this behavior is documented unambiguously. From the VGICv2
UAPI documentation:

"""
Userspace should set GICD_IIDR before setting any other registers (both
KVM_DEV_ARM_VGIC_GRP_DIST_REGS and KVM_DEV_ARM_VGIC_GRP_CPU_REGS) to ensure
the expected behavior. Unless GICD_IIDR has been set from userspace, writes
to the interrupt group registers (GICD_IGROUPR) are ignored.
"""

I'm not inclined to change that. As a way out of this whole mess, can we
instead:

 - Allow userspace to set IIDR.Revision to 1

 - Drop any bug emulation from the handling of IGROUPR registers

 - Special-case the stupid GICv2 UAPI where IGROUPR are only writable if
   the VMM has written to IIDR and the revision >= 2

Thanks,
Oliver
