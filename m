I understand. I'll leave the Windows issue the cover letter and write 
focused patch messages after splitting patches.

Then I think it makes sense to make KVM_ARM_VCPU_PMU_V3_SET_NR_COUNTERS 
mutually exclusive for consistency, but I found something weird with it.

The documentation says it already "mandates that a PMU has explicitly 
been selected via KVM_ARM_VCPU_PMU_V3_SET_PMU", but apparently that's 
not properly implemented.

kvm_arm_pmu_v3_set_nr_counters() has the following check:
	if (!kvm->arch.arm_pmu)
		return -EINVAL;

I suspect it is intended to check if a PMU has explicitly been selected, 
but this check is effectively no-op because kvm_arm_set_default_pmu() 
has already set kvm->arch.arm_pmu before reaching there.

Furthermore, tools/testing/selftests/kvm/arm64/vpmu_counter_access.c 
seems to expect KVM_ARM_VCPU_PMU_V3_SET_NR_COUNTERS to work without 
selecting a PMU via KVM_ARM_VCPU_PMU_V3_SET_PMU.

How should we deal with the discrepancy between the documentation and 
the implementation/selftest?

I'll update the attribute documentation accordingly.

I'll leave one line comment in the implementation corresponding to the 
attribute documentation.
