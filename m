It's fine by me as it doesn't change the spirit but improves the wording.

Ah, I hate doing this, I generally avoid "you" and "we" in docs but
given these ones are instructions it's easy to fall in the trap. I'll
try to improve it.

This is most often the case.

I think it's fine as is. I care a lot about giving clear instructions,
especially for first-time reporters, for whom it's always particularly
stressful to report a bug. With this update I think there's enough
guidance and it should help, so OK for me.

Agreed, let's leave it to the reporter to do what they want with the
instructions above and be done with it.

Jiri, does your Acked-by still stand with these adjustment ? If so, I'll
resend the updated version today or this week-end, as time permits.

Thanks!
