I agree, it's a matter of figuring out the best way to adopt this pattern. =
(For
those reading along, [1] details the Rust implementation to illustrate why =
it
may not make sense to adopt it in the same way).

I also don't think this should be reverted -- I think it makes sense to sta=
rt
experimenting to figure out what's the best way to adopt this pattern.

I think DRM has already shown interest in adopting this, and I think I have=
 also
seen patch series doing preparation work to be able to adopt this pattern a=
s
well.

Perhaps, to address some of the concerns, a good middle ground could be to =
mark
the feature as experimental with a separate Kconfig in the meantime?

[1] Revocable in Rust

In Rust (most) device resources are only ever handed out to drivers within =
an
opaque container type specific for device resources, hence it is named
Devres<T>.

The Devres container type uses the Revocable type internally to protect the
actual device resource; the resource is released automatically once the
corresponding device is unbound from the driver (for which it uses the "nor=
mal"
devres infrastructure).

There are mainly two ways to access a device resource with a Devres contain=
er:
Devres::access() and Devres::try_access().

Devres::access() provides a zero-cost access to the inner device resource, =
but
requires a proof that it is called from a scope where it is guaranteed that=
 the
device remains bound. This is achieved by Devres::access() taking a
&Device<Bound> argument, i.e. a reference (not reference count) of a device=
 that
is guaranteed to be bound for the entire lifetime of the reference.

Let's have a look at an example with an IRQ handler:

	struct MyIrqData {
	    bar: Devres<pci::Bar>,
	}

	impl irq::Handler for MyIrqData {
	    fn handle(&self, dev: &Device<Bound>) -> IrqReturn {
	        // Directly access the inner `pci::Bar`; fails if the resource
	        // did not originate from `dev`.
	        //
	        // (Internally, this is just a pointer comparison between `dev`
	        // and the device the `Devres` container has been created with.)
	        if let Ok(bar) =3D self.bar.access(dev) else {
	            return IrqReturn::None;
	        }

	        // `bar` is a `&pci::Bar`; no (S)RCU read side critical section
	        // involved.
	        bar.write32(...);

	        IrqReturn::Handled
	    }
	}

Since the Rust IRQ handler always guarantees that it won't race with device
unbind, we can provide a &Device<Bound> cookie and hence directly access th=
e
device resource with no cost. Due to the type system representation of the
device context state, this is checked at compile time.

We can do this for anything that guarantees a scope where the device must b=
e
bound. For instance, if we guarantee that a workqueue is torn down on devic=
e
unbind, we can provide a &Device<Bound> cookie for all work items scheduled=
 on
this workqueue. The same applies to subsystem and filesystem callbacks etc.

But, if we are in a scope where we don't have a &Device<Bound>, it means th=
at
this may be executed after device unbind. Consequently, drivers can't call
Devres::access() for direct access of the device resource (because it may b=
e a
UAF) and, instead, have to fall back to Devres::try_access() and friends.

Let's take some DRM IOCTL for instance:

	struct MyDriver {
	    bar: Devres<pci::Bar>,
	}

	fn ioctl_vm_create(
	    drm: &drm::Device<MyDriver>,
	    req: &mut uapi::drm_mydriver_vm_create,
	    file: &drm::File<MyDriverFile>,
	) -> Result<u32> {
	    // Runs the closure in an (S)RCU read side critical section if the
	    // resource is available, returns ENXIO otherwise.
	    drm.bar.try_access_with(|bar| {
	        // (S)RCU read side critical section starts here.

	        bar.write32(...);

	        // (S)RCU read side critical section ends here.
	    }).ok_or(ENXIO)?;

	    Ok(0)
	}

I think those examples make it obvious why a revocable implementation on th=
e C
side can't provide the same value and ergonomics due to language limitation=
s,
yet I think it makes sense to start experimenting how subsystems can adopt =
this
design-pattern in C.

One additional note, while this overall can come across a bit paranoid, it
achieves a clear goal: It becomes impossible for drivers to mess this up an=
d
create memory safety bugs, while at the same time causing zero overhead in =
hot
paths, that can be proven to not have a potential for such bugs in the firs=
t
place.
