I'll leave that decision up to the people who have to face the music.

But an alternative would be to add more warning levels to kernel-doc,
put the most verbose messages from the allmodconfig run behind some
-Wall knob, always run kernel-doc without that, and make W=1 run with
-Wall. It would be an iterative path forward.

Now Someone(tm) just needs to implement that. ;)
