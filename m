All of this is correct, but consider swaping in a vswap entry backed
by pswap. There are cases where you still want to maintain the pswap
slots around backing vswap entry, while having the swap cache folio as
well.

For e.g, at swap in time, we add the folio into the swap cache. First
of all, we need to hold on to the physical swap slot for IO step. But
even after IO succeeds, there are cases where you would still like to
keep physical swap slots around (for e.g, to avoid swapping out again
if the folio is only speculatively fetched).

So you have to make sure we have space for both the physical swap
slot, and the swap cache folio's PFN at the same time for each vswap
entry. So we still need the vtable extension (well maybe the other
approach I mentioned could work, but I'm not 100% sure).

Sounds like something that should be upstreamed? ;)

I was concerned that you might deem the overhead too high (so I came
up with the per-tier percpu caching), but honestly I like it a lot.

Exactly! That's what I'm thinking too. Basically I'm special-casing
for vswap here, but if you're happy with generalizing this for every
si I'm happy with it.

Yeah it's basically generalizing that check, and handle the case where
we can have indirection.

I mean I can open-code it, but it has to be there :) And I figure it
might be useful to check this opportunistically (at swap_pte_batch,
even if it's not guaranteed to be correct down the line) before we
even attempt to allocate a large folio etc. to avoid large folio
allocation.

That works-ish when the folio is sitll in swap cache, but say if it's
vswap backed by zswap (and the swap cache folio has been reclaimed),
you need a place to store the memcg, no?

Just seems cleaner to centralize this info at vswap layer when it is
presented, for now anyway, rather than juggling this on a per-backend
basis.

It's not terrible, TBH.
