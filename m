I'm not sure this is an actual problem.

When pages get rejected, they rotate to the furthest point from the
reclaimer - the head of the active list. We only get to them again
after we scanned everything else.

If all that's left on the LRU is unzswappable, then you'd assume that
remainder isn't very large, and thus not a significant part of overall
scan work. Because if it is, then there is a serious problem with the
zswap configuration.

There might be possible optimizations to determine how permanent a
rejection is, but I'm not sure the effort is called for just
yet. Rejections are already failure cases that screw up the LRU
ordering, and healthy setups shouldn't have a lot of those. I don't
think this patch adds any sort of new complications to this picture.
