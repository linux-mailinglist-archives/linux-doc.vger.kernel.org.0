FWIW, I'd unify on single # as root prompt or just throw away the prompt
altogether, and assume /sys/kernel/debug as the debugfs path. You can
mention somewhere the privileges the examples assume, as well as tell
people to replace /sys/kernel/debug with the actual debugfs path. I'd
also unwrap the lines instead of splitting to several lines.

BR,
Jani.
