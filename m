Hi Sadiya,

I made a similar observation the other day.
I'm glad to know I was not alone. :-)

I've got a response from Jon.
See: https://lore.kernel.org/r/874jswyat3.fsf@meer.lwn.net/

Returning to Sadiya's comment:

This link is identical to below. Did you mean

  https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v6.0-rc7/dev-tools/kunit/index.html

?

As I mentioned in the above mentioned mail, there looks like a room
of customizing alabaster. Yet, I am not able to get a sidebar as usable
as that of sphinx_rtd_theme so far.

Maybe due to my inexperience in CSS customization. :-\

sphinx_rtd_theme can be chosen by:

  make DOCS_THEME=sphinx_rtd_theme htmldocs

Konstantin, would it be possible for you to add "DOCS_THEME=sphinx_rtd_theme"
for the "latest" kernel documentation builds until the new default theme
becomes good enough for most people?  That is if Jon agrees.
For the "next" builds, alabaster theme should be OK, and easier for us to
compare the two themes.

        Thanks, Akira
