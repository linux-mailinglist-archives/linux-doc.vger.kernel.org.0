Yes. It says "module loaded" and lsmod shows that it is loaded indeed.
But you don't have any /dev/nullb*, so you can't do much with the module.

With this patch, it refuses to load the module.

I did not tested with all possible conditions, but I tested with the
following ones:

* Using a negative number of devices:
	- Previously, it would alloc and add a huge number of devices until the
system gets out of memory
	- With module_param as uint, it will throw a "invalid for parameter
`nr_devices'" and refuse to load

* Using a range of values (1, 10, 100, 1000):
	- It will works as expect, creating some /dev/nullbX accordingly with
your parameter. Works fine with and without this patch.
