    14	description: |
    15	  RISC-V has a large number of extensions, some of which are "standard"
    16	  extensions, meaning they are ratified by RISC-V International, and others
    17	  are "vendor" extensions.
    18	  This document defines properties that indicate whether a hart supports a
    19	  given extension.
    20	
    21	  Once a standard extension has been ratified, no changes in behaviour can be
    22	  made without the creation of a new extension.
    23	  The properties for standard extensions therefore map to their originally
    24	  ratified states, with the exception of the I, Zicntr & Zihpm extensions.
    25	  See the "i" property for more information.

    39	      https://riscv.org/specifications/
    40	
    41	      Due to revisions of the ISA specification, some deviations
    42	      have arisen over time.
    43	      Notably, riscv,isa was defined prior to the creation of the
    44	      Zicntr, Zicsr, Zifencei and Zihpm extensions and thus "i"
    45	      implies "zicntr_zicsr_zifencei_zihpm".
    46	
    47	      While the isa strings in ISA specification are case
    48	      insensitive, letters in the riscv,isa string must be all
    49	      lowercase.
