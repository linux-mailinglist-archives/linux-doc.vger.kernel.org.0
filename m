Yeah I can mention this. It's implied because 0 is the default value of
config fields, and 0 is a valid value for compare and count field, so
threshold=0 has to be the way to disable it. But I can mention it
explicitly.

They would count when the event is not equal to or less than the
threshold value on any cycle. Probably going into more detail would
start to reproduce what's in the reference manual. All the pseudocode is
in there which describes how it works.

As for use cases, I'm not really sure. It probably wasn't any effort to
add into the hardware with a single not gate, and something could have
been missed if it wasn't added. You might be able to do things like
count the inverse of something without having to open another event to
subtract from to find what the inverse would be.
