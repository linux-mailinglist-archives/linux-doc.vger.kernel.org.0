I did understand your workflow from the start, thank you. That's not the
problem.

I'm not sure that you understand our workflow. But it doesn't matter;
it's clear that they are different. In your workflow, the value for the
tag is subjective. In our workflow, it's not, it's unambiguous. And
there is really no point in debating the relative merits of the
workflows.

The *only* question is, whether we should both use the tag Foo: for the
different meanings and different workflows, or whether one should use
Foo: and the other should use Bar:.


BR,
Jani.
