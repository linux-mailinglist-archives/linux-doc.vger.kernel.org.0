Ah, I meant if we skip these parameters, we should not show it in the
command line via extra_command_line. This is still a minor issue at this
point. It should find early parameters in kernel.* parameters and do not
show it in extra_command_line, because those parameters are ignored.
So it is better to make a separated patch to fix that.

For example, if we pass

kernel.mem=1G

via bootconfig, it will be shown in the /proc/cmdline, but it is
not applied. This can confuse user.

Yes, but it is just different from existing one.
Suppose that if we have "early" and "normal" keys in the kernel, those
are handled by early_param() and __setup() respectively.

If we use bootconfig, like

 kernel {
   early = bconf_val
   normal = bconf_val
 }
 
And passes "early=foo normal=bar" via cmdline.

In this case, the /proc/cmdline eventually has

"early=bconf_val normal=bconf_val early=foo normal=bar"

And the "normal" callback called with "bconf_val" and "bar" twice.
However, "early" callback will be called with "foo" only once.

That can confuse users too.
I believe it's important for the system to behave in a way that is
as close as possible to the user's mind model.
Because the behavior is inconsistent when multiple parameters with
the same name are specified on the kernel command line, it is
necessary to ensure that users can later look at it and infer what
happened.

I mean, if a parameter is skipped, it should not be printed at
/proc/cmdline, because it can mislead user (and maybe bug reporter)
when a problem happens.

Yeah, that's complicated.

Agreed. My proposal is something like a divide and conquer approach.
Since these are implemented architecture by architecture, you need to
check the implementation for each architecture, and I think it's best
to implement them one by one using Kconfig.

Yes, that may require a substantial amount of work. But to improve
the kernel framework around the parameter handling, eventually we
need to examine each early parameter.

Basically, the memblock dependency comes from allocating copy of data.
Only for the embedded bootconfig, we can just pass copy memory block
to the xbc_init(). Something like;

xbc_init() {
 xbc_data = memblock_alloc();
 memcpy(xbc_data, data);
 __xbc_init(xbc_data);
}

embedded_xbc_init() {
  __xbc_init(embedded_bootconfig_data);
}

Afterwards, we can pass mixture of embedded bootcofnigt and initrd
bootconfig data to parser again.

(But in this case, we must be careful not to override the early
 parameters that we have already applied.)

Thank you,
