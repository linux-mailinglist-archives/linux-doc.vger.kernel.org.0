Thanks for summarizing the issues.

Before going further, I really would like to understand a few questions that I
already raised in the other thread here:

https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/YR%2F+gfL8RCP8XoB1@t490s/

They're:

  (1) Whether does mincore() suit your need already?

  (2) What would you like to do with swap entries in pagemap?

I'm more interested in question (2) because I never figured it out before, and
I really don't see how it would work even if the kernel can share swap format
to userspace.  E.g., right after you decided to "zero copy" that page, the page
can be faulted in right before live migration finishes, and it can be dirtied
again.  Then the page on the shared network storage will be stall, the same to
the swap entry you just scanned.

Thanks,
