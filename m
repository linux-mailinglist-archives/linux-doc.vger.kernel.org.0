Heh, the same applies to the current usage of htmldocs - specially
when SPHINXDIRS is used, e.g. one doing, for instance:

	make SPHINXDOCS=3Ddriver-api/<subsystem>

may not be interested on building rust docs, which, on such case,
may be a lot slower than a partial build. Also, I don't think that
rustdoc currently does something similar to SPHINXDOCS.

So, at least for me, it does make sense to have separate targets
for Sphinx, Rust and both (*).

(*) now, how such targets would be named is a completely different
    question.

Agreed.

IMO, this is a separate discussion, as you may need a different
toolset.

The way I see, for issue #350 IMO the best would be to create a=20
Sphinx extension similar to:

	Documentation/sphinx/parser_yaml.py

E.g. you would create a parser_rust.py module there, which would
generate ReST output from the rust code(*). Besides allowing cross
references between Sphinx, C and Rust, this would also allow
generating epub and pdf output.

(*) In practice, teaching rustdoc how to produce ReST output.
    Alternatively, rustdoc could generate a markdown output and use
    a sphinx markdown extension at parser_rust.py, to convert from
    MD to ReST like this extension:

	https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/markdown.html

Besides allowing cross references between Sphinx, C and Rust, a Sphinx
extension would also allow generating epub and pdf output, removing
all extra Makefile (or wrapper) code related to rustdoc.

-

Another alternative would be to use intersphinx, but I guess
making it working would be a lot more complex - as we don't even
support it yet on our current Sphinx output.
