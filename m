You did mention "local version for the subsystem", but maybe by local
you meant on their own box, rather than local to the subsystem. I
interpreted it as the latter, sorry about that!

Yeah, along the lines of the generic stuff it was suggested that I
should not add :)

I suppose it is a bit of a mix, since the document _is_ aimed at
maintainers of platform support (there's details about sending PRs etc),
but it does contain some conventions that "code" should follow, which
they should in turn pass down to contributors.

It sounds almost as if you're looking for something to present to people
when they add themselves as an `M:` entry against a driver, for when
$company sends a patch w/ someone you've not really seen before?
