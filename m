Alright, so we *do* agree at least on some parts. :)

I agree that any such change should not affect drivers. If you look at
the GPIO changes I did or the proposed nvmem rework - it never touched
drivers, only the subsystem level code. The latter especially is
really tiny, in fact:

  drivers/nvmem/core.c      | 172 +++++++++++++++++++++++---------------
  drivers/nvmem/internals.h |  17 +++-

is all you need to make it not crash in the situations I described
under that series. Runtime overhead in read-sections with SRCU or
read-write semaphores is negligible and typically we only have to
write on driver unbind. So that "wrapping every resource access"
sounds scary but really is not.

GPIO work was bigger but it addressed way more synchronization issues
than just supplier unbinding.

For I2C both the problem is different (subsystem waiting forever for
consumers to release all references) and the culprit: memory used to
hold the reference-counted struct device is released the supplier
unbind unconditionally. Unfortunately there's no way around it other
than to first move it into a separate chunk managed by i2c core. But
that's not the synchronization part that leaks into the drivers, just
the need to move struct device out of struct i2c_adapter.

During Saravana's talk at LPC we did briefly speak about whether it
would be possible to enforce devlinks for ALL devices linked in a
consumer-supplier fashion. I did in fact look into it for a bit on my
way back and it too would require at least subsystem-level changes
across all subsystems because you need to add that entry point at the
time of the resource being requested so it's not a no-cost operation.
But it is an alternative, yes though it'll require a comparable amount
of gap-plugging IMO.

Well, we do allow it at the moment. It doesn't seem like devlink will
be able to cover 100% of use-cases anytime soon.
