Just to follow-up: I did a quick test here to see if I could fix
"chromeos-common.sh" as you suggested.  Then I got rid of the Revert
and tried to login.  No joy.

Digging a little deeper, the ext4_dir_encryption_supported() function
is called in two places:
* chromeos-install
* chromeos_startup

In my test case I had a machine that I'd already logged into (on a
previous kernel version) and I was trying to log into it a second
time.  Thus there's no way that chromeos-install could be involved.
Looking at chromeos_startup:

https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/platform2/+/refs/heads/master/init/chromeos_startup

...the function is only used for setting up the "encrypted stateful"
partition.  That wasn't where my failure was.  My failure was with
logging in AKA with cryptohome.  Thus I think it's plausible that my
original commit message pointing at cryptohome may have been correct.
It's possible that there were _also_ problems with encrypted stateful
that I wasn't noticing, but if so they were not the only problems.

It still may be wise to make Chrome OS use different tests, but it
might not be quite as simple as hoped...
