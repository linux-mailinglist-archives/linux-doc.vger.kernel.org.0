Agreed. To give some context, Frank is an outreachy intern I am working with and
one of his starter tasks was to understand the ring buffer's basics.  I asked
him to send a patch since I thought he mentioned there was an error in the
documnentation. It looks like all that was missing is some explanation which
the deleted text in brackets above should already cover.

Steve, your call if you want this patch. Looks like Frank understands the
page header taking up some space, so one of the goals of the exercise is
accomplished ;-)

thanks,
