Having "how to submit patches" in MAINTAINTERS seems out of place.
We have a whole section of documentation about it, duplication
is harmful and a lot of the text looks really out of date.

Sections 1, 2 and 4 look really, really old and not applicable
to the modern process.

Section 3 is obvious but also we have build bots now.

Section 5 is a bit outdated (diff -u?!). But I like the part
about factoring out shared code, so add that to process docs.

Section 6 is unnecessary?

Section 7 is covered by more appropriate docs.

-List of maintainers and how to submit kernel changes
-====================================================
-
-Please try to follow the guidelines below.  This will make things
-easier on the maintainers.  Not all of these guidelines matter for every
-trivial patch so apply some common sense.
-
-Tips for patch submitters
--------------------------
-
-1.	Always *test* your changes, however small, on at least 4 or
-	5 people, preferably many more.
-
-2.	Try to release a few ALPHA test versions to the net. Announce
-	them onto the kernel channel and await results. This is especially
-	important for device drivers, because often that's the only way
-	you will find things like the fact version 3 firmware needs
-	a magic fix you didn't know about, or some clown changed the
-	chips on a board and not its name.  (Don't laugh!  Look at the
-	SMC etherpower for that.)
-
-3.	Make sure your changes compile correctly in multiple
-	configurations. In particular check that changes work both as a
-	module and built into the kernel.
-
-4.	When you are happy with a change make it generally available for
-	testing and await feedback.
-
-5.	Make a patch available to the relevant maintainer in the list. Use
-	``diff -u`` to make the patch easy to merge. Be prepared to get your
-	changes sent back with seemingly silly requests about formatting
-	and variable names.  These aren't as silly as they seem. One
-	job the maintainers (and especially Linus) do is to keep things
-	looking the same. Sometimes this means that the clever hack in
-	your driver to get around a problem actually needs to become a
-	generalized kernel feature ready for next time.
-
-	PLEASE check your patch with the automated style checker
-	(scripts/checkpatch.pl) to catch trivial style violations.
-	See Documentation/process/coding-style.rst for guidance here.
-
-	PLEASE CC: the maintainers and mailing lists that are generated
-	by ``scripts/get_maintainer.pl.`` The results returned by the
-	script will be best if you have git installed and are making
-	your changes in a branch derived from Linus' latest git tree.
-	See Documentation/process/submitting-patches.rst for details.
-
-	PLEASE try to include any credit lines you want added with the
-	patch. It avoids people being missed off by mistake and makes
-	it easier to know who wants adding and who doesn't.
-
-	PLEASE document known bugs. If it doesn't work for everything
-	or does something very odd once a month document it.
-
-	PLEASE remember that submissions must be made under the terms
-	of the Linux Foundation certificate of contribution and should
-	include a Signed-off-by: line.  The current version of this
-	"Developer's Certificate of Origin" (DCO) is listed in the file
-	Documentation/process/submitting-patches.rst.
-
-6.	Make sure you have the right to send any changes you make. If you
-	do changes at work you may find your employer owns the patch
-	not you.
-
-7.	When sending security related changes or reports to a maintainer
-	please Cc: security@kernel.org, especially if the maintainer
-	does not respond. Please keep in mind that the security team is
-	a small set of people who can be efficient only when working on
-	verified bugs. Please only Cc: this list when you have identified
-	that the bug would present a short-term risk to other users if it
-	were publicly disclosed. For example, reports of address leaks do
-	not represent an immediate threat and are better handled publicly,
-	and ideally, should come with a patch proposal. Please do not send
-	automated reports to this list either. Such bugs will be handled
-	better and faster in the usual public places. See
-	Documentation/process/security-bugs.rst for details.
-
-8.	Happy hacking.
