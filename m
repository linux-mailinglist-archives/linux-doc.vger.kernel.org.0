And same as the browser can display HTML documents in pretty much any
character set independently of your system locale Sphinx should be able
to produce those for your browser to display independent of the system
locale. Same for LaTeX, PDF, or whatver else.

It has nothing to do with python developer POV on handling strings or
principles of python.

The python support for handling strings is complete in the sense it does
not depend on the system locale and can handle strings in multiple
charcter sets. Sphinx as program written in python could handle
documents in any encoding supported by python independent of system
locale if Sphinx developers bothered to use the python encoding support
correctly. Apparently they did not.

Or it's a good example of people never testing the application for the
case where explicit handling is required, and possibly one of the
reasons more requirements for explicit handling of the encoding were
added. In the end it merely led to changing from universal ASCII
encoding to universal UTF-8 encoding with no support for running python
scripts in any locale that does not use the 'universal' encoding.

I think that the idea was to make scripts resilient to encoding errors
and prevent data corruption by raising an exception when mishandling of
encoding is detected but instead of handling the exceptions people just
punted to using the same encoding all the time.
