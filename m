I was probably not clear in my question. It is quite clear that frozen
applications are inactive. It is not really clear why they should be
treated any differently though. Their memory will be naturally cold as
the memory is not in use so why cannot we realy on the standard memory
reclaim to deal with the implicit inactivity and you need to handle that
explicitly?

Yes there are heuristics which might override the global swappinness but
have you investigated those cases and can show that those heuristics
could be changed?

Flexibility is really nice but it comes with a price and interface cost
can be really high. There were several attempts to make memory reclaim
LRU type specific but I still maintain my opinion that this is not
really a good abstraction. As stated above even page cache is not all
the same. A more future proof interface should really consider the IO
refault cost rather than all anon/file.
