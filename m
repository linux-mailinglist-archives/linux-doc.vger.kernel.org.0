Hi David,

Thanks for your review and opinion :) I really appreciate it!
I'm sorry that I'm not that familiar with the mail sending in lore, so my
earlier reply in
https://lore.kernel.org/all/8F6F0691-91A1-4645-A218-2219DE6047AD@icloud.com/ 
may be in a wrong format, if you haven't read it, just ignore it, and read
this mail instead, I also revised the reply a little in this mail. thanks. :)

Yes, I know this history, and I know that it will cost some memory or latency,
That’s why I was wondering maybe I can add a switch to it to make it
configurable :). But I don’t know the existence of the discussion in 
https://lore.kernel.org/r/20251226100337.4171191-1-zhangqilong3@huawei.com,
I’ll check it out, thanks for informing me that :).

The reason why I want to use THP over hugetlb is that I need reclamation for my
workload :). There are many processes in my workload that need 2M
aligned folios for better performance, and we want to reclaim them back automatically
when the process doesn’t need the folios. But hugetlbfs cannot do passive reclamation
from what I know (except doing active madvise by the processes themselves). And using
THP can easily split the hugepages. So that’s why I would like to add certainty for THP,
and use THP for these processes as backend, because THP is very well integrated with
the swap system and other filesystems. And from what I checked,
it seems the most common case for splitting a THP is COW and swapping so I am trying
to handle these two scenarios (But coincidentally, PMD swapping is committed in
https://lore.kernel.org/all/D3F08F85-76E0-4C5A-ABA1-537C68E038B8@nvidia.com/
a few days before, which is a great implementation :) ).

Oh, the reason why I added a switch globally is also because the scenario I mentioned
above, I want those processes to always use PMD sized folios as backend to make sure
performance. COW is truly not that common like swap out/swap in, it just can happen
sometimes, which I guess the reason may be about image duplication. Setting the system
globally is more convenient for my situation :). I can go without this global switch
if it's more reasonable.

And for PMD-sized THPs, actually, I’m also considering adding more support for
COW to mTHP if the upstream consider it useful. And also for pud sized THPs
also. But I guess I have to firstly handle stage 1: PMD level COW now :).
And also, since PMD sized folio is commonly used in my workload, I'm also wondering
digging into pmd sized KSM in the future, in which I think pmd sized COW may
be more useful then :).

Sorry for that, the concrete workload itself hasn't been finished yet. Now it just
can happen sometimes in my multi-2M-sized-processes workload test. But the user
of our 2M sized folio schema is actually not necessarily myself but also can be the
userspace developers. I cannot guarantee that fork will not be used in the
performance test of their workload since that is a normal posix call. Maybe a little
overthinking? :)
I just think swap and COW are two main scenarios that may transparently split pmd sized
folios, so maybe we can solve it and make THP both reclaimable and stable. Maybe
that can make THP more widely used in real deployed environment since the resource
can become more controllable for the users :). That's why I was thinking maybe
implementing it with setup switches is a reasonable solution?

MADV_DONTFORK and MADV_COLLAPSE are nice and great options :), but the former one seems
to be a little wasteful :). And the latter one can greatly solve fork situation, but
we have to recognize all the possible regions that may be accessed in performance
test and collapse them. And it's also not easy to solve the situation like pmd swap in
for pmd pages mapped by more than two processes. :)
