Sorry I am traveling in a different time zone so not able to get to
that email sooner. That email is only sent out less than one day
before the V6 patch right?

I disagree about no use case. No use case for Meta !=3D no usage case
for the rest of the linux kernel community. That mindset really needs
to shift to do Linux kernel development. Respect other's usage cases.
It is not just Meta's Linux kernel. It is everybody's Linux kernel.

I can give you three usage cases right now:
1) Google producting kernel uses SSD only swap, it is currently on
pilot. This is not expressible by the memory.zswap.writeback. You can
set the memory.zswap.max =3D 0 and memory.zswap.writeback =3D 1, then SSD
backed swapfile. But the whole thing feels very clunky, especially
what you really want is SSD only swap, you need to do all this zswap
config dance. Google has an internal memory.swapfile feature
implemented per cgroup swap file type by "zswap only", "real swap file
only", "both", "none" (the exact keyword might be different). running
in the production for almost 10 years. The need for more than zswap
type of per cgroup control is really there.

2) As indicated by this discussion, Tencent has a usage case for SSD
and hard disk swap as overflow.

3) Android has some fancy swap ideas led by those patches.
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-mm/20230710221659.2473460-1-minchan@kernel.or=
g/
It got shot down due to removal of frontswap. But the usage case and
product requirement is there.

> make too much sense to build up that heavy machinery now.

Does my minimal memory.swap.tiers patch to support "zswap" and "all"
sound heavy machinery to you?
It is the same implementation under the hood. I am only trying to
avoid introducing something that will be foreseeable obsolete.

I respect that urgent need, that is why I Ack on the V5 path, under
the understanding that this zswap.writeback is not carved into stones.
When a better interface comes alone, that interface can be obsolete.
Frankly speaking I would much prefer not introducing the cgroup API
which will be obsolete soon.

If you think zswap.writeback is not removable when another better
alternative is available, please voice it now.

If you squash my minimal memory.swap.tiers patch, it will also address
your urgent need for merging the "zswap.writeback", no?
