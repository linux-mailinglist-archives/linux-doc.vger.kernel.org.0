Commit ed318a6cc0b6 ("fscrypt: support test_dummy_encryption=v2") added an
entry to the massive option table in Documentation/filesystems/f2fs.txt.
The option was too wide for the formatting of the table, though, leading to
a verbose and ugly docs-build warning starting with:

    Documentation/filesystems/f2fs.rst:229: WARNING: Malformed table.
    Text in column margin in table line 126.

Fixing this requires formatting the whole table; let's hear it for Emacs
query-replace-regexp.  No changes were made to the actual text.

Fixes: ed318a6cc0b6 ("fscrypt: support test_dummy_encryption=v2")

-                       will be turned off. If background_gc=sync, it will turn
-                       on synchronous garbage collection running in background.
-                       Default value for this option is on. So garbage
-                       collection is on by default.
-disable_roll_forward   Disable the roll-forward recovery routine
-norecovery             Disable the roll-forward recovery routine, mounted read-
-                       only (i.e., -o ro,disable_roll_forward)
-discard/nodiscard      Enable/disable real-time discard in f2fs, if discard is
-                       enabled, f2fs will issue discard/TRIM commands when a
-		       segment is cleaned.
-no_heap                Disable heap-style segment allocation which finds free
-                       segments for data from the beginning of main area, while
-		       for node from the end of main area.
-nouser_xattr           Disable Extended User Attributes. Note: xattr is enabled
-                       by default if CONFIG_F2FS_FS_XATTR is selected.
-noacl                  Disable POSIX Access Control List. Note: acl is enabled
-                       by default if CONFIG_F2FS_FS_POSIX_ACL is selected.
-active_logs=%u         Support configuring the number of active logs. In the
-                       current design, f2fs supports only 2, 4, and 6 logs.
-                       Default number is 6.
-disable_ext_identify   Disable the extension list configured by mkfs, so f2fs
-                       does not aware of cold files such as media files.
-inline_xattr           Enable the inline xattrs feature.
-noinline_xattr         Disable the inline xattrs feature.
-inline_xattr_size=%u   Support configuring inline xattr size, it depends on
-		       flexible inline xattr feature.
-inline_data            Enable the inline data feature: New created small(<~3.4k)
-                       files can be written into inode block.
-inline_dentry          Enable the inline dir feature: data in new created
-                       directory entries can be written into inode block. The
-                       space of inode block which is used to store inline
-                       dentries is limited to ~3.4k.
-noinline_dentry        Disable the inline dentry feature.
-flush_merge	       Merge concurrent cache_flush commands as much as possible
-                       to eliminate redundant command issues. If the underlying
-		       device handles the cache_flush command relatively slowly,
-		       recommend to enable this option.
-nobarrier              This option can be used if underlying storage guarantees
-                       its cached data should be written to the novolatile area.
-		       If this option is set, no cache_flush commands are issued
-		       but f2fs still guarantees the write ordering of all the
-		       data writes.
-fastboot               This option is used when a system wants to reduce mount
-                       time as much as possible, even though normal performance
-		       can be sacrificed.
-extent_cache           Enable an extent cache based on rb-tree, it can cache
-                       as many as extent which map between contiguous logical
-                       address and physical address per inode, resulting in
-                       increasing the cache hit ratio. Set by default.
-noextent_cache         Disable an extent cache based on rb-tree explicitly, see
-                       the above extent_cache mount option.
-noinline_data          Disable the inline data feature, inline data feature is
-                       enabled by default.
-data_flush             Enable data flushing before checkpoint in order to
-                       persist data of regular and symlink.
-reserve_root=%d        Support configuring reserved space which is used for
-                       allocation from a privileged user with specified uid or
-                       gid, unit: 4KB, the default limit is 0.2% of user blocks.
-resuid=%d              The user ID which may use the reserved blocks.
-resgid=%d              The group ID which may use the reserved blocks.
-fault_injection=%d     Enable fault injection in all supported types with

 test_dummy_encryption
 test_dummy_encryption=%s
-                       Enable dummy encryption, which provides a fake fscrypt
-                       context. The fake fscrypt context is used by xfstests.
-                       The argument may be either "v1" or "v2", in order to
-                       select the corresponding fscrypt policy version.
-checkpoint=%s[:%u[%]]  Set to "disable" to turn off checkpointing. Set to "enable"
-                       to reenable checkpointing. Is enabled by default. While
-                       disabled, any unmounting or unexpected shutdowns will cause
-                       the filesystem contents to appear as they did when the
-                       filesystem was mounted with that option.
-                       While mounting with checkpoint=disabled, the filesystem must
-                       run garbage collection to ensure that all available space can
-                       be used. If this takes too much time, the mount may return
-                       EAGAIN. You may optionally add a value to indicate how much
-                       of the disk you would be willing to temporarily give up to
-                       avoid additional garbage collection. This can be given as a
-                       number of blocks, or as a percent. For instance, mounting
-                       with checkpoint=disable:100% would always succeed, but it may
-                       hide up to all remaining free space. The actual space that
-                       would be unusable can be viewed at /sys/fs/f2fs/<disk>/unusable
-                       This space is reclaimed once checkpoint=enable.
-compress_algorithm=%s  Control compress algorithm, currently f2fs supports "lzo",
-                       "lz4", "zstd" and "lzo-rle" algorithm.
-compress_log_size=%u   Support configuring compress cluster size, the size will

-====================== ============================================================
+			 Enable dummy encryption, which provides a fake fscrypt
+			 context. The fake fscrypt context is used by xfstests.
+			 The argument may be either "v1" or "v2", in order to
+			 select the corresponding fscrypt policy version.
+checkpoint=%s[:%u[%]]	 Set to "disable" to turn off checkpointing. Set to "enable"
+			 to reenable checkpointing. Is enabled by default. While
+			 disabled, any unmounting or unexpected shutdowns will cause
+			 the filesystem contents to appear as they did when the
+			 filesystem was mounted with that option.
+			 While mounting with checkpoint=disabled, the filesystem must
+			 run garbage collection to ensure that all available space can
+			 be used. If this takes too much time, the mount may return
+			 EAGAIN. You may optionally add a value to indicate how much
+			 of the disk you would be willing to temporarily give up to
+			 avoid additional garbage collection. This can be given as a
+			 number of blocks, or as a percent. For instance, mounting
+			 with checkpoint=disable:100% would always succeed, but it may
+			 hide up to all remaining free space. The actual space that
+			 would be unusable can be viewed at /sys/fs/f2fs/<disk>/unusable
+			 This space is reclaimed once checkpoint=enable.
+compress_algorithm=%s	 Control compress algorithm, currently f2fs supports "lzo",
+			 "lz4", "zstd" and "lzo-rle" algorithm.
+compress_log_size=%u	 Support configuring compress cluster size, the size will
+			 be 4KB * (1 << %u), 16KB is minimum size, also it's
+			 default size.
+compress_extension=%s	 Support adding specified extension, so that f2fs can enable
+			 compression on those corresponding files, e.g. if all files
+			 with '.ext' has high compression rate, we can set the '.ext'
+			 on compression extension list and enable compression on
+			 these file by default rather than to enable it via ioctl.
+			 For other files, we can still enable compression via ioctl.
