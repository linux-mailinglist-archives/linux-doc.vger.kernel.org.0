I was bringing myself up to speed on LSMs and discovered that this
base doc file is out of date. Unless I'm mistaken the "stacking"
functionality is still in significant flux (and also I am of course a
newbie here) so I haven't really _added_ any info, mainly this patch
removes misleading bits and fixes rotten references.

 - Since commit b1d9e6b0646d ("LSM: Switch to lists of hooks") as
   part of the work helpfully summarised in [1], the LSM hooks are
   stored in a table of hlists, the security_ops structure is
   gone. The stacking of security modules no longer seems to be
   deferred to the module.

 - security_hooks_heads, née security_ops, doesn't have the
   sub-structures described here. The "future" flattening described
   here appears to have happened a long time ago (In my hasty git
   archaeology session I didn't find the old code at all).

 - There used to be a dummy LSM implementing "traditional superuser
   logic", with the "capability" LSM as an optional layer, but since
   commit 5915eb53861c ("security: remove dummy module") that is no
   longer the case.

 composing hooks in the base framework. Additionally, LSM would still
 need global hooks for operations that have no process context (e.g.
 network input operations). Consequently, LSM provides global security
-hooks, but a security module is free to implement per-process hooks
-(where that makes sense) by storing a security_ops table in each
-process' security field and then invoking these per-process hooks from
-the global hooks. The problem of composition is thus deferred to the
-module.
-
-The global security_ops table is initialized to a set of hook functions
-provided by a dummy security module that provides traditional superuser
-logic. A :c:func:`register_security()` function (in
-``security/security.c``) is provided to allow a security module to set
-security_ops to refer to its own hook functions, and an
-:c:func:`unregister_security()` function is provided to revert
-security_ops to the dummy module hooks. This mechanism is used to set

-LSM also provides a simple mechanism for stacking additional security
-modules with the primary security module. It defines
-:c:func:`register_security()` and
-:c:func:`unregister_security()` hooks in the :c:type:`struct
-security_operations <security_operations>` structure and
-provides :c:func:`mod_reg_security()` and
-:c:func:`mod_unreg_security()` functions that invoke these hooks
-after performing some sanity checking. A security module can call these
-functions in order to stack with other modules. However, the actual
-details of how this stacking is handled are deferred to the module,
-which can implement these hooks in any way it wishes (including always
-returning an error if it does not wish to support stacking). In this
-manner, LSM again defers the problem of composition to the module.

+Some LSMs can be "stacked" meaning multiple LSMs' hooks can be called
+sequentially, while others are "exclusive" - see
+LSM_FLAG_EXCLUSIVE. The "capability" LSM is built in with

 LSM Capabilities Module
 =======================
 
 The LSM kernel patch moves most of the existing POSIX.1e capabilities
-logic into an optional security module stored in the file
-``security/capability.c``. This change allows users who do not want to
-use capabilities to omit this code entirely from their kernel, instead
-using the dummy module for traditional superuser logic or any other
-module that they desire. This change also allows the developers of the
-capabilities logic to maintain and enhance their code more freely,
-without needing to integrate patches back into the base kernel.
