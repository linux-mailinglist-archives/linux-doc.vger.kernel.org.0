That's basically what I said: such things happen top/down and not at
developer/maintainer level. Sure having it documented somewhere, on
some document that management would actually read can be useful on
discussions, specially when companies hire a third party company to
help with their upstream process.

The point is: a developer-focused document - or even a submission
document process won't affect how companies do their inner source
development: companies that have internally heavy development teams
will basically keep running their own internal development cycle,
being concerned about upstream only when their product managers
authorize them to publicly disclosure patches.

If the goal is to create a management awareness about how to better
cope with upstream, then my suggestion is to write a new document
from scratch [1] focusing specifically on that, containing a list of
best practices with focus on orienting management inside companies 
about how to deal with developers and maintainers working on
upstream.

[1] there is a document there already that seems to be focused at
    management style, but it doesn't cover any best practices
    with regards to innersource/upstream:

It is not about being better/worse. It is about fitting inside the
innersource processes related to quality ensurance (QA). 

Vendors that see their Linux driver as part of their product delivery have 
such processes and won't be willing to accept patches that don't pass on
their processes.

So, all patches (internal or external ones) need to be submitted to
their QA processes, effectively meaning that someone inside such 
companies should be responsible for reviewing the patch.

Heh, you can see this even on distributions like Debian, Ubuntu, 
Fedora, openSUSE - and even on open source userspace projects:
if you submit a bug report or a patch, someone will handle
the ticket, reviewing your patch and/or writing their own patches
to solve the issues.

Inside companies (in special big ones), it usually means that a 
manager or a triage team will pick the bug report/issue and then 
delegate it to an internal developer, who will be internally
owning the upstream patch set, doing tests, reviews and running
it on the company's CI tools.

Smaller companies, companies that are starting now with their
upstream process and companies where Linux is not their main focus
usually delegate it to third party companies, who will be handling
it on their behalf or have small open source teams. Those are the
ones where changing processes are easier. 

Bigger companies have more complex development processes. Among those,
there are the ones where Linux is part of their products. They
are usually responsible for a vast amount of Kernel patches[1].
Changing their process is hard and takes a lot of time/efforts.

[1] Looking at https://lwn.net/Articles/972605/, it can be seen
that: 7.4% is unknown, 6.8% is none and 2.0% consulting, meaning
that more than 80% is credited to "direct" contribution.
Granted, part of those were actually be done by third parties
(or with their help). Still, just the top 17 companies listed there
are responsible for more than 50% of the upstream changes. I bet
that almost all of those (if not all) have their own internal 
innersource processes, and patches are only accepted once the
company developers/maintainers handled external patches and have
them passed though their QA systems.

Thanks,
Mauro
