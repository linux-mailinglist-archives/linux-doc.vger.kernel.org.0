We do use at least namespacing which was new to Sphinx 3.1. And we could
use more if we weren't so conservative about the versions.

If you're using distro-packaged Sphinx, or use pip system/user install,
specifying exact package requirements like 2.4.4 does not really make
sense to me. I don't want kernel requirements to interfere with whatever
else I'm doing. You should just specify the minimum Sphinx version using
needs_sphinx in conf.py, maybe based on [1].

On the other hand, if you're using a virtual environment, what's the
point in holding back to a version as old as 2.4.4? You might just as
well go for latest, specifying only the top level dependencies,
i.e. sphinx and pyyaml. Or you could pip freeze all the requirements at
a relatively new known good configuration. That's kind of the idea with
the virtual environment.

That's really the only two (or three) approaches that make sense to
me. Using a virtual environment to use ancient versions is just weird.


BR,
Jani.
