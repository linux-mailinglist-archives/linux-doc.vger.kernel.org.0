Hopefully these would already be balanced out pretty well before you
run a test, or there is a risk that whatever outstanding allocations
there are can cause a large number of frees during your test that
don't match up to your recorded allocation events. Resetting to zero
doesn't eliminate the risk of such background noise.

Again, there simply is no mathematical difference between

	reset events to 0
	run test
	look at events - 0

and

	read events baseline
	run test
	look at events - baseline

Overflows are just a fact of life on 32 bit systems. However, they can
also be trivially handled - you can always subtract a ulong start
state from a ulong end state and get a reliable delta of up to 2^32
events, whether the end state has overflowed or not.

The bottom line is that the benefit of this patch adds a minor
convenience for something that can already be done in userspace. But
the downside is that there would be one more possible source of noise
for kernel developers to consider when looking at a bug report. Plus
the extra code and user interface that need to be maintained.

I don't think we should merge this patch.
