for info, this qemu series was merged laterly.

[PATCH v10 0/7] Mitigation of "failed to load
cpu:cpreg_vmstate_array_len" migration failures <https://lore.kernel.org/all/20260420140552.104369-1-eric.auger@redhat.com/#r>
https://lore.kernel.org/all/20260420140552.104369-1-eric.auger@redhat.com/#r

It brings an infrastructure to mitigate some migration failures accross different kernel versions.

Also there is [PATCH v4 00/17] kvm/arm: Introduce a customizable aarch64 KVM host model, under review
https://lore.kernel.org/all/20260503073541.790215-1-eric.auger@redhat.com/

This series aims at beeing able to offer the capacity to set writable ID regs on the host passthrough vcpu model.

Thanks

Eric
