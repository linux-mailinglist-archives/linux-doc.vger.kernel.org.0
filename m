 To let users optimize DAMOS schemes with such special knowledge, DAMOS provides
 a feature called DAMOS filters.  The feature allows users to set an arbitrary
-number of filters for each scheme.  Each filter specifies the type of target
-memory, and whether it should exclude the memory of the type (filter-out), or
-all except the memory of the type (filter-in).
+number of filters for each scheme.  Each filter specifies

+- a type of memory (``type``),
+- whether it is for the memory of the type or all except the type
+  (``matching``), and
+- whether it is to allow (include) or reject (exclude) applying
+  the scheme's action to the memory (``allow``).
+
+When multiple filters are installed, each filter is evaluated in the installed
+order.  If a part of memory is matched to one of the filter, next filters are
+ignored.  If the memory passes through the filters evaluation stage because it
+is not matched to any of the filters, applying the scheme's action to it is
+allowed, same to the behavior when no filter exists.
+
+For example, let's assume 1) a filter for allowing anonymous pages and 2)
+another filter for rejecting young pages are installed in the order.  If a page
+of a region that eligible to apply the scheme's action is an anonymous page,
+the scheme's action will be applied to the page regardless of whether it is
+young or not, since it matches with the first allow-filter.  If the page is
+not anonymous but young, the scheme's action will not be applied, since the
+second reject-filter blocks it.  If the page is neither anonymous nor young,
+the page will pass through the filters evaluation stage since there is no
+matching filter, and the action will be applied to the page.
+
+Note that the action can equally be applied to memory that either explicitly
+filter-allowed or filters evaluation stage passed.  It means that installing
+allow-filters at the end of the list makes no practical change but only
+filters-checking overhead.
 
 For efficient handling of filters, some types of filters are handled by the
