Fwiw, I have a need for client orientated debug message store, with
the primary purpose of figuring out -EINVAL. We need per-client so we can
put sensitive information about the potentially buggy client behaviour,
and of course it needs to be accessible by the non-privileged client.

On the execution side, it's easy to keep track of the client so we could
trace execution flow per client, within reason. And we could do
similarly for kms clients.

Just chiming to say, I don't think a duplicate of dmesg hidden inside
debugfs achieves much. But a generic tracek-esque ringbuf would be very
useful -- even if only so we can separate our GEM_TRACE from the global
tracek.
