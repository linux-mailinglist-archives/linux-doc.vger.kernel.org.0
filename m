May you have some misunderstanding on 'fidelity', it means faithful on the original
meaning, not the word by word translation. 
And still didn't see 'work' has this meaning of 'fluency' here.

May we don't bother to change, if new words aren't clearly better than old one, 
otherwise we may get busy on changes without much benefits.

search google online, I got "About 7,820,000 results (0.31 seconds)"
for 逆向工程， and "About 64,900,000 results (0.33 seconds)" for 反向工程.
Clearly the latter used more common.

Someone 'make some noise' doesn't mean he/she's work is useless, it could
be a praise with a bit jealous. 'noise' here is a kind of modest, not 
meaning these emails are useless or annonying.

'post' may a trandtion usage here. If you use a English email client, you will
find a button name 'send' not 'post'. That's different word.

This word do bother me at first time. it used with a English prof's suggestion.

Uh, I hit the Murphy's Law here. and believe the English word may has the same
issue.  :)
According the context, reader should understood this action is incorrect, as
you already knew. Adding a word '错误/falsely' could make meaning more clear. 
but since the original doc doesn't do this.... 
Maybe another way could make it clear too? 

首先，相信内核编码标准并不重要，也不强制执行。但是事实上，如果没有按照标准对。。。
