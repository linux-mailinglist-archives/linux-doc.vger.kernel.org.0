Since the key range can grow without accruing a process startup time
penalty, this proposal handles vendor extensions fairly well, no?
(Contrasting at least against hwcap bits, which once allocated have to
be copied into every new process forever).

That makes sense. In this case, the proposal is that RISC-V would use
this mechanism and generally abandon hwcap. So my hope is there should
still only be about 2 spots to maintain.
