That sounds like a way forwards. If we do end up with a more complex ABI long term
we can always add it to this driver if useful - but only once we know what it needs
to look like.

If you are doing FSK or PSK they are almost always detached from the driver as driven by
some high speed external source.  This chip is probably massive overkill for anyone
wanting to do something so simple. So maybe it's not a thing.
If we need to retrofit it I can see assigning a new _symbol type label to
channels as a way to make it obvious how they are related.  Can solve
that when we need to (if we ever do!)

Agreed it is mostly about debugging but I think this thing is complex enough
that it's useful info.  I guess we could put it in debugfs for now.

It's the external use of the profile pins that makes me wonder if we
will need this at somepoint. For now it may just be a case of making
sure there is room in the channel numbering etc which I guess there
already is.

Given the overlap is non obvious I think that making it clear the channel is not
in use makes sense.  Mind you it's a bit of an odd interface to return -EBUSY on
reads but allow writes.  I'd like others input on this one.
