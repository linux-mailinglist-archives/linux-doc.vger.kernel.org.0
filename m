I think you have this the wrong way up. This should describe what HVC_SOFT_RESTART does.

We want to remove some extra work kexec does on arm64, and both implementations of
HVC_SOFT_RESTART on arm64 already do what we need. The change here should be to document
that the D/I bits are cleared after a HVC_SOFT_RESTART on arm64.

I don't think we should remove this. KVM on 32bit was the only implementer, but if there
ever is another, this is how it should work.

(I don't think disable the D-cache is what the bit does, it forces the attributes that are
used for a data access).

Please just describe this as the on arm64 the D and I bits are cleared.
(it might be true on 32bit, I can't work the assembly out).


Thanks,

James
