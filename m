Dear,
How are you doing today? I got your contact from a directory and
picked interest to communicate you by faith, though we have not met
before, I believe we can achieve something together. My husband died
few years ago after battling with brain cancer, before his death, he
deposited ($10.5 Million) in one of the financial institution. He
wanted to establish coco processing factory and also real estate
business.

After the death of my husband, I have been receiving all manner of
life threats from the family members, now the pressure is getting more
severe I decided to leave this country. Please can you partner with me
and receive the fund in your account while I come over there with my
son for investment. If you  agree, get back for more details and what
will be your commission for the assistance. I wait for your reply,
Mary Jane Kallon
