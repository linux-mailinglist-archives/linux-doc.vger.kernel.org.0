No. The application itself is not UTF-8. The application input files are.

The big issue with the way python works with charsets is due to that:
it does a very poor job with regards to that.

I remember that in the past I had to use this quite often
(before UTF-8 being default on the distros I was using on that time):

	LANG=3DC <some_python_script>

Just to avoid them to crash.

If I'm not mistaken, older Fedora/Mandrake distros had some bugs with
python-written scripts that, if the machine's language were not
English, such scripts crash, as the i18n translated messages were
on a different charset than what the python script would be expecting.

That may not be true on certain parts of the globe.

I've no idea what charsets the most-used distributions in Asian
Countries use use ;-)

Thanks,
