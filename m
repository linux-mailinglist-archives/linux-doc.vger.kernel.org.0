Ok I see the case you are referring to now. This can be a follow-up patch to
address the case, because.. the limitation you mentioned is also something
inherrent in the (traditional) physical page_idle tracking if that were used.
The reason being, after swapping, the PTE is not mapped to any page so there
is nothing to mark as idle. So if the page gets swapped out and in in the
meanwhile, then you would run into the same issue.

But yes, we should certainly address it in the future. I just want to keep
things simple at the moment. I will make a note about your suggestion but you
are welcomed to write a patch for it on top of my patch. I am about to send
another revision shortly for futhre review.

thanks,

 - Joel
