Ah, but I do think this is the way forward, given that the pattern/idea
works in the rust side of the kernel, and it's exactly what I've been
asking for for years now :)

But yes, without a real user, it's hard for me to justify it.  But, I
want it present in the tree now so that lots of others can play with it
easily.  If it turns out it is not correct, and does not work properly,
then great, we will delete the files entirely.  But I'm not so sure that
we are there yet.
