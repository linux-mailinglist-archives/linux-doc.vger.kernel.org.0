Yup, I saw this when I was doing the work and already sent an email
last week about it but got no response:
https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/201909231450.4C6CF32@keescook/

I suppose I could literally just send the missing file instead?

Yes -- I think a big part of this is the amplification of the subsystem
links (they're in the navigation right-hand side too), but I think that
making them reachable externally was important so a maintainer can have
a stable URL to point to their MAINTAINTERS file entry.

Yup, it's a lot to parse, but it *seems* to be caching it correctly.

Cool! Thanks for the help on it. :)
