Makes sense to me, but IMO it should also be describing what companies
are losing with closed-door discussions: money and time to market. 

The usual excuse for innersource development practices is that this speeds
up product development. In practice, this is often a false premise.

Investing on closed door discussions and then send patch series only
when internal development is done has two major drawbacks from company PoV:

- Other companies with faster/better upstream companies may end having
  solutions merged upstream quicker, reducing or eliminating company market 
  competitive advantages. Also, it means that the internal development will
  need to restart from the beginning, to follow the kAPI interfaces that
  were  proposed/added by other vendors;

- Even if the company is the first to upstream, maintainers may not
  agree with the developed solution, requiring substantial changes,
  and delaying product delivery.
