Yes, something I have definitely considered.

In this case it would have meant a new symbolic link for every
coresight device, so twice a many entries under
$(SYS)/bus/coresight/device/.  That would have been a lot of clutter
and an increasing source of problems as the number of CPU and sinks
increases.  To me, and given the permissive definition of "testing"
found in the documentation, a clean break was a better option.

Other than local shell scripts I am not aware of any tools using these
today.  I am certainly open to discuss a better alternative but right
now, I just don't see one.
