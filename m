That makes sense to me.

It sounds to me like per-cgroup swapfiles would be the easiest
solution to this. Then you can create zram devices with different
configurations and assign them to individual cgroups.

This would also apply to Kairu's usecase: assign zrams and hdd backups
as needed on a per-cgroup basis.

In addition, it would naturally solve scalability and isolation
problems when multiple containers would otherwise be hammering on the
same swap backends and locks.

It would also only require one, relatively simple new interface, such
as a cgroup parameter to swapon().

That's highly preferable over a complex configuration file like
memory.swap.tiers that needs to solve all sorts of visibility and
namespace issues and duplicate the full configuration interface of
every backend in some new, custom syntax.
