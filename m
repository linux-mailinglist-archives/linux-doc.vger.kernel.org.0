Paul, do we also nuke rcu_eqs_special_set()?  Currently I don't see anyone
using it. And also remove the bottom most bit of dynticks?

Also what happens if a TLB flush broadcast is needed? Do we IPI nohz or idle
CPUs are the moment?

All of this was introduced in:
b8c17e6664c4 ("rcu: Maintain special bits at bottom of ->dynticks counter")

thanks,
