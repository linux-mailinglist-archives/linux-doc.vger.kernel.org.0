> "flowers"?  Did the LLM put that out too? :)

No, you should blame me for the description ;-) I didn't ask LLM
to write it for me. On past experiments, LLM is not great writing
texts - specially with open models that run fine with 16GB VRAM.
I might have asked it to review(*).

I was trying to say that: while LLM worked fine for the task of
doing an English grammar review for the strings, being able to
distinguish them from the actual code, it was not is perfect:=20
some things required manual work to fix.

(*) asking it to review with this prompt:

	"review the test below and produce a version with English spelling fixed:
	 <patch description>"

Gave:

	"There are some typos and English errors in the comments of kernel=E2=80=
=91doc.py.

	 Locate them with the help of an LLM (gpt=E2=80=91oss 14B), executed local=
ly with this prompt:
=20
	review English grammar and syntax at the comments on the code below:
	<cat scripts/kernel-doc.py>

	Not all results are perfect, although the LLM caught several minor issues.
	Add the relevant fixes, discarding the incorrect ones."

Asking it to explain what changed with:

	"what changes you did? why?"  (**)

using ollama with gpt-oss:latest (14B) gave:

Why these changes were made
---------------------------

  - Spelling =E2=80=93 The text contained a handful of typographical errors=
=20
    (excecuted, synatx). Fixing them prevents confusion and gives=20
    the reader confidence in the quality of the documentation. =20

  - Punctuation =E2=80=93 Adding a period after the final sentence makes the
    paragraph a complete statement. =20

  - Clarity =E2=80=93 Adding a space between grammar and syntax keeps the=20
    instruction legible. =20

  - Professional tone =E2=80=93 Corrected wording preserves the informal =
=E2=80=9Cflowers=E2=80=9D
    metaphor while ensuring that the rest of the instruction reads cleanly.
</llm_output>

Not a bad review.

Funny enough, on (5) it understood my metaphor, but it ended replacing
it to "Not all results are perfect", probably to give a "professional
tone".

(**) Yeah, that prompt is grammatically incorrect: I should have used=20
     "did you do?" but, as I'm playing with LLM, I like to write prompts
     with typos and other problems to see how well a 14B or less models
     would get it right :-D

     Sometimes I even change my language during prompts... it is funny
     that sometimes it follows my lead and change the language as well,
     while, on others, it keeps using the initial language... I even got
     a case were it randomly switched to a completely different language.
    =20
> The changes themselves look fine.

Good! want me to send a new version to improve description?

Thanks,
Mauro
