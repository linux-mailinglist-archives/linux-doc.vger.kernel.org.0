Hi all,

[TLDR Summary]
 - This series introduces a new driver to support ARM SCMI Telemetry
 - The previous (till v4) FS-based ABI driver is gone: no equivalent
   FUSE support is planned, either, due to the implicit performance hit
 - A new simple chardev driver exposing am IOCTLs ABI is proposed
 - V5 focus is on the new UAPI (i.e. definitely missing to address some
   previous V4 reviews...they will be taken care in v6)

The upcoming SCMI v4.0 specification [0] introduces a new SCMI protocol
dedicated to System Telemetry.

In a nutshell, the SCMI Telemetry protocol allows an agent to discover at
runtime the set of Telemetry Data Events (DEs) available on a specific
platform and provides the means to configure the set of DEs that a user is
interested into, while reading them back using the collection method that
is deeemed more suitable for the usecase at hand. (...amongst the various
possible collection methods allowed by SCMI specification)

Without delving into the gory details of the whole SCMI Telemetry protocol
let's just say that the SCMI platform/server firmware advertises a number
of Telemetry Data Events, each one identified by a 32bit unique ID, and an
SCMI agent/client, like Linux, can discover them and read back at will the
associated data value in a number of ways.
Data collection is mainly intended to happen on demand via shared memory
areas exposed by the platform firmware, discovered dynamically via SCMI
Telemetry and accessed by Linux on-demand, but some DE can also be reported
via SCMI Notifications asynchronous messages or via direct dedicated
FastChannels (another kind of SCMI memory based access): all of this
underlying mechanism is anyway hidden to the user since it is mediated by
the kernel driver which will return the proper data value when queried.

Anyway, the set of well-known architected DE IDs defined by the spec is
limited to a dozen IDs, which means that the vast majority of DE IDs are
customizable per-platform: as a consequence, though, the same ID, say
'0x1234', could represent completely different things on different systems.

Precise definitions and semantic of such custom Data Event IDs are out of
the scope of the SCMI Telemetry specification and of this implementation:
they are supposed to be provided using some kind of JSON-like description
file that will have to be consumed by a userspace tool which would be
finally in charge of making sense of the set of available DEs.

IOW, in turn, this means that even though the DEs enumerated via SCMI come
with some sort of topological and qualitative description provided by the
protocol (like unit of measurements, name, topology info etc), kernel-wise
we CANNOT be completely sure of "what is what" without being fed-back some
sort of information about the DEs by the afore mentioned userspace tool.

For these reasons, currently this series does NOT attempt to register any
of these DEs with any of the usual in-kernel subsystems (like HWMON, IIO,
PERF etc), simply because we cannot be sure which DE is suitable, or even
desirable, for a given subsystem. This also means there are NO in-kernel
users of these Telemetry data events as of now.

So, while we do not exclude, for the future, to feed/register some of the
discovered DEs to/with some of the above mentioned Kernel subsystems, as
of now we have ONLY modeled a custom userspace API to make SCMI Telemetry
available to userspace tools.

With V5 we drop the FS-based ABI approach, as it has been recently rejected
upstream, and we move to a pure chardev/IOCTL approach.

INTERFACES

For each discovered SCMI Instance a character device named tlm_<N> is
created under /dev/scmi/ subtree.

The IOCTL interface described at 'include/uapi/linux/scmi.h' is made
available to enumerate and configure Telemetry resources: Telemetry data
can be collected using a few different IOCTls, depending on the required
granularity.

Alternatively it is possible to obtain a list of the file descriptors
referencing directly the underlying SCMI Telemetry SHMTI memory areas and
implement in user space an SCMI Telemetry parser accessing directly the
SHMTI, while staying in compliance with the SCMI TDCF format.

NOTE THAT from v3 onwards the firmware interface level NOW supports ONLY
the latest SCMI v4.0 specification [0].

KNOWN ISSUES/IMPROVEMENTS/TODO
 - still to look at Sashiko complaints
 - a few V4-related review comments to address
 - review SCMI Telemetry in-protocol notification handling
 - maybe better to have a single unified TLM_CFG IOCTL with a variable
   payload composed of TLV items ?
 - what about RO static resource enumeration via mmaped areas as an
   alternative to a bunch of enumeration IOCTLs that we have now ?
 - maybe better to have one single mmap'able area where all the TDCFs
   are collected at proper offsets, instead of one distinct mmap for each
   TDCF ?
 - add generation counter IOCTL support
 - add Telemetry RESET IOCTL support
 - stlm tool utility is crappy and minimal ... as of now just for testing
   or development...serious rework needed to make it upstreamable

Based on V7.2-rc1, tested on an emulated setup.

This series is available also at [1].

If you still reading...any feedback welcome :P

Thanks,
Cristian
