It seems they can benefit of this child channel concept, as they define
multiple frequency and phase configuration for the same physical DAC.
I see the following in the most complicated one:
- out_altvoltage0_frequency0
- out_altvoltage0_frequency1
- out_altvoltage0_frequency_scale
- out_altvoltage0_phase0
- out_altvoltage0_phase1
- out__altvoltage0_phase_scale
- out_altvoltage0_pincontrol_en
- out_altvoltage0_frequencysymbol
- out_altvoltage0_phasesymbol
- out_altvoltage0_out_enable
- out_altvoltage0_out1_enable
- out_altvoltage0_out0_wavetype
- out_altvoltage0_out1_wavetype
- out_altvoltage0_out0_wavetype_available
- out_altvoltage0_out1_wavetype_available

less complicated, no RAM, no DRG nor parallel port. In terms of common stuff I can see
frequency_scale and pinctrl_en.

This part seems special, so I would not bother with the fact that userspace
needs to figure some things out.

Since there is this priority, there is a difference on enable vs active,
and things are different for each DDS parameter. Take the single tone example
when it is enabled, should that mean that it is active on frequency, phase
or amplitude? that granularity could be exposed like that if we create dedicated
channels for each parameter on every mode possible, which turns the ABI into
a greater mess.

I still think it is not that simple, an enable is just a control for
a specific mode-destination pair.

As mentioned above, that would be messy to interface with...

Yes, some users may want to control the profile pins through an FPGA.

active_params or active_targets? listing out DDS parameters that is currently
active for that mode/channel? like printing "frequency phase amplitude", so
that would mean the mode is driving all of them. That would be a read-only
status.

Most of the RAM configuration is now comming from the firmware, so there
is no much info to display/configure in multiple channels. The per-profile
configs require the weird ABI like operating modes and address start/end.
By removing those, I have mostly "global" stuff.

and what would happen when we power up and none of the profiles are enabled?

Indeed. To that, we add registers with different sizes and we have a bad digital design.

You mean the destination? I removed the destination ABI. so now destination is
set when we write to either frequency, phase or scale properties.
* writing to frequency or frequency_step sets the destination to frequency
* writing to phase or phase_step sets the destination to phase
* writing to scale or scale_step sets the destination to amplitude

The DRG mode (dwell mode) is now controlled with the enable bits in the ramp
up/down channels

That would depend on what the user does. This part has this DRHOLD pin
which can freeze the ramp. If the user sets this HIGH and creates pulses
it is able to control the stepping of the RAMP manually. But I assume
that no one would do that... such application is unknown to me.

Yes. RAM mode is good and bad at the same time. Good because you can have a
flexible and budget friendly way to create custom frequency/phase/amplitude
patterns. A microcontroller and the DDS could do a lot with that. For other
fancy stuff we would need an FPGA.

OSK has the highest priority of all, but it only acts on the amplitude.
