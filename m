Hi Mauro,

about wording: I will use the term "book" for a SPHINXDIR and "bookshelf"
for the whole kernel documentation ..

Your grep is wrong (it also matches the :doc: from kernel-include), use:

    $ git grep ':doc:`'|wc -l
    83

The opposite of pointing to a file is, that we can only point the
file not a content in the file and we lost the flexibility of
dynamical referencing by target's name: If the target is moved,
the refs has to be changed also.  Not used right now, but we also
lost the ability to link from one "book" to another "book" in
the "bookshelf" or even into other books available in the WEB
(this is what intersphinx can do).

  Its a decission what counts more.

Can't believe, there must have been other reasons.

Why should a http link does not work in a PDF file? .. I mean, its
just inserting HTTP links.

I can't speak for other, but I often prefer a book with links in over
a complete bookshelf holding in my hands ;)
