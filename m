Mm, yes, this one might be something we can just ignore in the TXT case.

That presumably depends on how much state is in the measured region -
we can't just measure the code in order to assert that we're secure.

I'm fine with a solution that involves jumping through some hoops, but
it feels like simply supporting measuring and passing through the
runtime services would be fine - if you want to keep them outside the
TCB, build a kernel that doesn't have EFI runtime service support and
skip that measurement?
