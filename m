In terms of implementation, the obvious tradeoff is that it adds more 
code to implement the feature. One thing to note is that 
kvm_vcpu_load_pmu() is added and is called each time a vCPU migrates 
across pCPUs. The heavy part, making the KVM_REQ_RELOAD_PMU request, 
only happens when the feature is enabled.

All CPUs may trap the relevant registers with IMPDEF but some of them 
may not have compatible PMUs. As I wrote in the previous email, I don't 
think it will happen in practice.

kvm_arm_pmu_v3_set_pmu() has the following condition:

if (kvm_vm_has_ran_once(kvm) ||
     (kvm->arch.pmu_filter && kvm->arch.arm_pmu != arm_pmu)) {
	ret = -EBUSY;
	break;
}

kvm_arm_pmu_v3_set_pmu_fixed_counters_only() has the corresponding 
condition for consistency:

if (kvm_vm_has_ran_once(kvm) ||
     (kvm->arch.pmu_filter &&
      !test_bit(KVM_ARCH_FLAG_PMU_V3_FIXED_COUNTERS_ONLY,
	       &kvm->arch.flags)))
	return -EBUSY;

We can of course kill the PMU event filter for FIXED_COUNTERS_ONLY. The 
filter is effectively no-op with FIXED_COUNTERS_ONLY and I don't think 
that consistency matters much.

None. It's only for this feature. We can add a check of the feature flag 
at the beginning of the function to avoid that loop.

Thanks for the pointer. I'll make a change to make the flags mutually 
exclusive and test it with an amended QEMU patch that follows what 
kvmtool does.

What kind of documentation do you expect? If we change 
kvm_vcpu_load_pmu() to avoid for_each_set_bit(), there would be a good 
chance to forget updating it when mechanically updating existing 
for_each_set_bit() instances, so it is a candidate for documentation.
