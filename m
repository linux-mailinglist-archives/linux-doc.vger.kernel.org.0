Then, placing it under Documentation/maintainer is not the right
place ;-)

Well, hallway track, invitation-only events and such aren't exactly
"open forums".

Assuming that this got moved to a contributor's document, as from your
comments the target audience is ocasional community contributors,
see my comments below.

This seems to vague and meaningless to an occasional community
developer.

For instance, how someone that sends a contribution to subsystem X 
knows if the subsystem is a "larger subsystem", so it is "typical"?
What's the "typical" rules?

Btw, larger subsystems usually have their own set of rules. A couple
of them are documented at maintainer-profile.rst, but most don't.

IMO, this is somewhat out of scope. I mean, what a contributor should
expect from this?

I bet a new contributor to a driver made by company X, after reading
this paragraph, would try to submit patches privately to company X
maintainers, which seems to be the opposite from the message you
wanted to give.

In the light of a contributor focused document, I would be a lot
more direct here, using a text similar to this:

	Please don't send patches or reply privately to discussions
	initiated on public forums, as most maintainers won't appreciate
	such kind of behavior. Private communications outside company's
	own internal discussions are usually tolerated only when there 
	are very good reasons for that, like when talking about
	undisclosed security issues.

It is clear now, but as Dan pointed out, this is the wrong document
for contributors, as Documentation/maintainers are focused on
maintainers ;-)

So, if something has to be added there, it should be to try to
setup a baseline for maintainer's typical behavior.

> Not reply privately that "it's on the company roadmap, just wait" :|

I'm afraid that, in the first case, we'll still see this privately,
as companies won't be disclosing publicly what it is on their
roadmaps.

"Forgotten" patches should indeed be sent publicly for review.
The text I added earlier should hopefully cover it.

Perhaps a note about that at the beginning of
Documentation/process/submitting-patches.rst could be more
effective, e. g. something like this:

diff --git a/Documentation/process/submitting-patches.rst b/Documentation/process/submitting-patches.rst

Again, you placed the comments at the maintainer's document, where
the scope of of "don't do this" is too limited. I would expect
that people that volunteered themselves to do some maintainership 
are more willing to react to positive messages about the expected
maintainer's behavior.

On a contributor's document, though, I agree with you that a set
of rules like don't do top posting, don't submit patches privately,
and such are more effective.

Thanks,
Mauro
