I think that all this is motivated by adding support for module
specific groups.

What about storing the group as yet another information for each
message? I mean the same way as we store module name, file, line,
function name.

Then we could add API to define group for a given message:

   pr_debug_group(group_id, fmt, ...);

the interface for the control file might be via new keyword "group".
You could then do something like:

   echo module=drm group=0x3 +p >control

But more importantly you should add functions that might be called
when the drm.debug parameter is changes. I have already mentioned
it is another reply:

    dd_enable_module_group(module_name, group_id);
    dd_disable_module_group(module_name, group_id);


It will _not_ need any new flag or flag filtering.

Petr
