If Stephen thinks it is fine to drop the clamping logic, I think it is
fine too. I think it would probably be good to replace it with a
comment under the TODO that explains that a hung test *can* cause an
oops if the hung task timeout is less than the kunit timeout value. It
would probably be good to also select a timeout value that is less
than the default hung task timeout. We might also want to link to this
discussion. I fully expect that the timeout logic will get more
attention at some point in the future.

One more thing: Alan, can you submit the commit that drops the
clamping logic in its own commit? I would prefer to make sure that it
is easy to spot in the commit history.

Cheers!
