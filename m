Subject: [PATCH v2] docs: maintainer: discourage taking conversations off-list
Date: Sat, 13 Jul 2024 16:50:20 -0700

Multiple vendors seem to prefer taking discussions off list, and
ask contributors to work with them privately rather than just send
patches to the list. I'd imagine this is because it's hard to fit in
time for random developers popping up with features to review into
packed schedule. From what I've seen "work in private" usually means
someone on the company side will be assigned to handle the interaction,
possibly months later. In worst case, the person scheduled to help
the contributor takes over and writes the code themselves.
This is not how the community is supposed to work.

The discussion on v1 wasn't very conclusive. I am not capable of
distilling many of the suggestions into meaningful changes.
I believe the paragraph works in the context of the document.

FWIW the paragraph has been consulted with 2 contributors to whom
the described situation has happened.

Encouraged by the immediate acks from notable folks I'm submitting
again, although I'm tempted to resend as part of maintainer-netdev :(
Please do read the rest of the doc to understand the context:
https://docs.kernel.org/next/maintainer/feature-and-driver-maintainers.html

v2:
 - replace mailing list with "forum" to avoid excluding GH / GitLab etc
 - call out private >email< conversations, face-to-face conversations
   are obviously fine
v1: https://lore.kernel.org/20240712144903.392284-1-kuba@kernel.org/

+Open development
+----------------
+
+Discussions about user reported issues, and development of new code
+should be conducted in a manner typical for the larger subsystem.
+It is common for development within a single company to be conducted
+behind closed doors. However, development and discussions initiated
+by community members must not be redirected from public to closed forums
+or to private email conversations. Reasonable exceptions to this guidance
+include discussions about security related issues.
