So I applied this and built it.  There may be potential in this
approach, but I don't think we are there yet.

This change completely loses the organization that I wanted to put onto
the front page itself.  That page will be the place where people land
first, so it should guide them to somewhere useful as quickly and easily
as possible.  With this change, we've hidden that guidance in a
subsidiary page and the front is back to a random collection of
unordered stuff.

The front page, I think, is more important than the sidebar.

We really need to look into the actual generation of the sidebar; it's
on my list, but won't happen before the merge window.  I do appreciate
playing with ideas, though - please keep it up!  We'll figure out
something eventually...:)

Thanks,

jon
