I agree on that. The documentation can be update to reflect that. Common
logic would say that we should set things up before powering up, that
should be the guidance here as well.

Agree, setting mode and powering up are not coupled anywhere in the API.
framework does not care about it. There might be provider limitations
which should be handled internally.

Yes but I would say rather than order, a guidance would help users and
providers. Set things up and power up would be a good logic to follow.

If the provider supports setting/switching mode up when running, we
should not limit that. I dont see a reason for limiting that from an
framework.
