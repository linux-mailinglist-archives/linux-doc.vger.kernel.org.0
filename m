Yeah, Python (and almost all python apps) has a mad behavior when
it finds an unexpected character: instead of ignoring it, it
just crashes. On Sphinx, this is is even worse, as it blames
the parallel building, instead of pinpointing the real culprit.

In this specific case, crashing due to an invalid char sent to
the logger sounds pretty stupid to me, as what really matter
is the built documents.

Well, IMO, for things like logger, python or Sphinx should internally
be ding something similar to:

	$ iconv -t latin-1//IGNORE

e. g. if the system's charset is latin-1, it should ignore all charset
errors at the logger, converting the charset the best way it can
without crashing.

As, unfortunately, this is not happening, conf.py should do something
like hardcoding env{LANG}=3D<lang>.utf-8 (or something similar),
in order to to eliminate the risk of crashes.

Thanks,
Mauro
