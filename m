Besides the below questions, here's another:

My current module has 6 .rst files.  Is that usual, or is it
recommended that the entire module be in one big file?

I know either works, but I want to follow the customary
pattern.

I know I can do it, but is it recommended or discouraged?

I can add a link to a .rst file.  If someone links to my doc, it implies 
that my filename cannot change.  Similarly, if I link to another doc, I 
depend on that filename not changing.

That's an example.  If I link like that, and then the name changes to 
trusted-encryptedxxx.rst, I break.

Then don't links break?
