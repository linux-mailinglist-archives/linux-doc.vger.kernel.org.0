Hi Dongliang, Weijie,

Right -- which means the real workload is smaller than the raw numbers
suggest. For files where the pending commits turn out to be
English-only fixes, the update can be a trivial baseline bump
(an "update to commit HASH" commit with little or no content change),
so the tool's numbers stay meaningful without inventing work.

s.

Good to know the convention is recent -- zh_TW can simply adopt it
from the first series onward.

Will do, thanks for the pointer.

Weijie: agreed, a zh_TW how-to (mirroring the zh_CN one, with the
glossary referenced) looks like the natural follow-up once the first
series settles the terminology. Adding it to the list.

So, to keep everything in one place, my understanding of the plan:

- Chen-Yu: terminology series for process/ (14 files), folding in the
  pending 8.Conclusion changes, glossary included; adopt the
  "update to commit HASH" convention from now on
- Chen-Yu: read Jon's advice for new-language efforts (Spanish thread)
- later: a zh_TW how-to document
- Weijie: investigate which documents may not need translation;
  monitor the CN/TW lists during the trial period
- Dongliang: review; patches routed through Alex's tree (pending
  Alex's confirmation)

If I got anything wrong, please correct me -- otherwise I will get
started on the series.

Thanks,
Chen-Yu
