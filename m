Honestly we're seeing this through the angle of a patch that lists a
single paragraph but the doc is already becoming quite long. I'm a bit
afraid of adding long enumerations, or sentences which do not immediately
translate to something recognizable by reporters. Not that it cannot be
done, but I think the current situation warrants incremental improvements
by fixing what doesn't work well. And indeed most of the capabilities
based reports currently revolve around "I already have CAP_{SYS,NET}_ADMIN
and ...". That might remain a good start for now.

I don't remember when we last got a report for it but it's not frequent.
Again, I think we should continue to focus on efficiency, i.e. the number
of improperly routed reports we can stop per word written/read.
