Yes.  It's easier to review if this is added at the point where it is
used.

Mentioning VFs in the comment is a slight misdirection when the actual
concern is just about the number of devices.

If it's practical to arrange it so we dereference a NULL pointer or
similar, that's my preference because it doesn't take extra code and
it's impossible to ignore.  Sometimes people add "if (!ptr) return
-EINVAL;" to internal functions where "ptr" should never be NULL.  IMO
cases like that should just use assume "ptr" is valid and use it.
Likely not a practical strategy in your case.

I'm objecting more to using the return value of pci_WARN_ONCE() than
the warning itself.  It's not really obvious what WARN_ONCE() should
return and kind of a hassle to figure it out, so I think it's clearer
in this case to test dev_ser directly.

OK.  Maybe just remove the comment.  It's self-evident that
WARN_ON_ONCE() is a "shouldn't happen" situation, and I don't think
the comment contains useful information.

Right.  Here's what I was thinking:

  pci_liveupdate_flb_get_incoming(...)
  {
    struct pci_ser *ser = *serp;

    ser->nr_devices = 0;

    ret = liveupdate_flb_get_incoming(...);
    ...
    if (ret == -ENOENT) {
      pr_info_once("PCI: No incoming FLB data detected during Live Update");
      return;
    }

    WARN_ONCE(ret, "PCI: Failed to retrieve incoming ...");
  }

  u32 pci_liveupdate_incoming_nr_devices(void)
  {
    pci_liveupdate_flb_get_incoming(&ser);
    return ser->nr_devices;
  }

Agreed.
