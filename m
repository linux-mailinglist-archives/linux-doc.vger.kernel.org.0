Assuming we'll want userspace to have the option of choosing version=0,
and that we're fine with version=0 being the implicit choice, when nothing
is selected, then I guess it can be left as is for now. If, OTOH, we just
want migration to fail when attempting to migrate to another host with
an incompatible stolen-time structure (i.e. version=0 is not selectable
on hosts that implement later versions), then we should expose the version
in some way now. Perhaps a VCPU's "PV config" should be described in a
set of pseudo registers?

Actually even if a single memslot is used for all the PV structures for
all VCPUs, but it's separate from the slot(s) used for main memory, then
we'll likely see performance issues with memslot searches (even though
it's a binary search). This is because memslots already have caching. The
last used slot is stored in the memslots' lru_slot member (the "lru" name
is confusing, but it means "last used" somehow). This means we could get
thrashing on that slot cache if we're searching for the PV structure
memslot on each vcpu load after searching for the main memory slot on each
page fault.

I also can't think of any reason why we'd have to describe it in DT/ACPI,
but I get this feeling that if we don't, then we'll hit some issue that
will make us wish we had...
