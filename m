FWIW, I've been using the new tracers extensively downstream for a while
now and I find them very useful and quite more precise to detect
problems than what we currently have available.

The fact that one can do almost everything needed to spot latency issues
from entirely inside the kernel with a simple interface is a big plus to me
as well.

I wouldn't mind if this gets accepted very soon! :)

Best,
Juri
