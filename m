Yes, I agree, but I think that is fine.

If the caller does a fundamental change to an existing struct pci_epf_bar,
between two set_bar() calls... they have no one to blame but themselves.

At least the check will be able to detect when the second set_bar() call
is supplied a new struct which does not have the same size / flags as the
struct pci_epf_bar that is currently in use.

The same currently applies to clear_bar():
If you do a stupid in place update of the struct pci_epf_bar after calling
set_bar(), e.g. modifying epf_bar->barno, clear_bar() will absolutely do
"bad things".

Perhaps we should update the comment in dw_pcie_ep_set_bar():

To make it clear that this safety check is not always possible.

I did not change my mind a second time :)

So I still think X is the way to go.


Kind regards,
