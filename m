That didn't quite work as is. I changed it to this:

+       return if ($file =~ m,\.(rej|org|orig|bak)$,);

which works (dropping the leading "/").

That line is already present in the script, for skipping
hidden (dot) files.

It does not skip filenames like "papr_hcalls.orig" -- at least I
still see this problem when that line is present.

I wouldn't suggest skipping any file that has a '.' in its name.
