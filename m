+RCU on Uniprocessor Systems
+===========================
 
 A common misconception is that, on UP systems, the call_rcu() primitive
 may immediately invoke its function.  The basis of this misconception
 is that since there is only one CPU, it should not be necessary to
 wait for anything else to get done, since there are no other CPUs for
