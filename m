(I did see the smiley), I'm on board with throwing random drivers in 
arch/riscv. :)

The situation here didn't seem very far from what process/2.Process.rst 
says about staging:

- "a way to keep track of drivers that aren't up to standards", though 
in this case the issue is not coding standards or quality---the code is 
very good---and which people "may want to use"

- the code could be removed if there's no progress on either changing 
the RISC-V acceptance policy or ratifying the spec

Of course there should have been a TODO file explaining the situation. 
But if you think this is not the right place, I totally understand; if 
my opinion had any weight in this, I would just place it in arch/riscv/kvm.

The RISC-V acceptance policy as is just doesn't work, and the fact that 
people are trying to work around it is proving it.  There are many ways 
to improve it:

- get rid of it;

- provide a path to get an exception;

- provide a staging place sot hat people to do their job of contributing 
code to Linux (e.g. arch/riscv/staging/kvm).

If everything else fail, I guess we can place it in 
drivers/virt/riscv/kvm, even though that's just as silly a workaround. 
It's a pity because the RISC-V virtualization architecture has a very 
nice design, and the KVM code is also a very good example of how to do 
things right.
