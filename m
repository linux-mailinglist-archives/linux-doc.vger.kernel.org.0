What got me worried originally is the example Kees provided which
creates a collision of a 12-character abbreviated commit ID:

$ git log 1da177e4c3f4
error: short object ID 1da177e4c3 is ambiguous
hint: The candidates are:
hint:   1da177e4c3f41 commit 2005-04-16 - Linux-2.6.12-rc2
hint:   1da177e4c3f47 commit 2024-12-14 - docs: git SHA prefixes are for humans

When I tested it locally, my scripts were broken, our CVE scripts were
broken, and it is quite the PITA to address after the fact (think of all
the "Fixes: 1da177e4c3f4 [...]" lines we have in the log).

So sure, we don't have a collision right now, but going from 0 to 1 is
going to be painful.

Are we going to be actively watching for someone trying to sneak in a
commit like that, or should we just handle that case properly?

I ended up with this fun thing:

git log --pretty=format:'%B' | grep -E '^Fixes:[[:space:]][0-9a-fA-F]{8,40}' | while read -r line; do
     [[ $line =~ ^Fixes:[[:space:]]([0-9a-fA-F]{8,40})(.*) ]] && \
     ! git rev-parse --quiet --verify "${BASH_REMATCH[1]}^{commit}" >/dev/null 2>&1 && \
     { r=$(./scripts/git-disambiguate.sh --force "${BASH_REMATCH[1]}" "${BASH_REMATCH[2]}"); \
     [[ -n $r ]] && echo "Bad: $line" && echo "Good: Fixes: $(git ol "$r")"; }

Which looks for these wrong IDs in "Fixes:" tags and tries to run them
through git-disambiguate.sh:

Bad: Fixes: d71e629bed5b ("ARC: build: disallow invalid PAE40 + 4K page config")
Good: Fixes: 8871331b1769 ("ARC: build: disallow invalid PAE40 + 4K page config")
Bad: Fixes: 7e654ab7da03 ("cifs: during remount, make sure passwords are in sync")
Good: Fixes: 0f0e35790295 ("cifs: during remount, make sure passwords are in sync")
Bad: Fixes: ee650b3820f3 ("apparmor: properly handle cx/px lookup failure for complain")
Good: Fixes: db93ca15e5ae ("apparmor: properly handle cx/px lookup failure for complain")
[...]

This one is indeed in the 4.18 stable tree.

Is the concern mostly around the term "disambiguate"? Would
git-sanitize.sh work better?
