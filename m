A filsystem driver for telemetry like this is really misguided. I think
shell access is really not an argument for adding a filesystem into the
kernel like this. That's just not appropriate justification to push
thousand and thousands of lines of code into the kernel.

You're building completely new infrastructure. The format is whatever it
is. If you stream it somehow just add a binary that userspace can use to
consume or translate it. If you need a filesystem interface for
convenience build it via FUSE on top of whatever streams that data and
get it ouf of the kernels way.

You also buy into all kinds of really wonky properties. If you split it
over multiple files you can never get a snapshot of data that is
consistent if it's across multiple files.

Telemetry over a filesystem is just not a great idea. If you did it via
sysfs I really wouldn't care because all because the infrastructure
already exists and I couldn't be bothered if this grew yet another wart
but as a separate massive hand-rolled pseudofs, no I'm not seeing it.
