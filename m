Yeah, that sounds a good approach: teach rustdoc target to handle
SPHINXDOCS. If it is empty (or just ".") handle the same way as
today. Otherwise, do a partial doc build or skip when it doesn't
make sense.

I'm not talking about stop using rustdoc. I'm talking about using
it to output on a format that Sphinx can understand, and let Sphinx
do the final output, solving cross-references.

There is a JSON Sphinx plugin (although I never used - no idea if
it would do what it is needed):
	https://sphinx-jsonschema.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

If this won't work, I guess it wouldn't be hard to use parser_yaml.py as
an example to write a new plugin to handle rustdoc JSON output.
