Better say "Add documentation for ublk subsystem. It was supposed to be
documented when merging the driver, but missing at that time."

The documentation can be improved:

  - Its slug should be added to table of contents (index.rst)
  - Use footnote syntax for external references
  - The wordings are weird, almost to the point that I can't comprehend
    it (barely understand the meaning).

Here's the improv:
