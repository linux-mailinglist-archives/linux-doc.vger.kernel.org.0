Yes, that's correct. It kind of works for single-channel ADCs, but half of the
data we see in user space is valid and the other half is not. For two-channel
ADCs, everything should be fine.

Currently, it's just one part that is single-channel (AD4030). If patches 6 and
7 were accepted, it would be 3 single-channel parts supported. I can add an `if`
somewhere to check the number of channel, but it will eventually have to be
removed when HDL gets fixed.

Or, if HDL can't be fixed, then we'll need the `if` now and something else
latter to filter out extra data before pushing to IIO buffers as mentioned
above. Though, this scenario seems odd to me as I think the HDL wouldn't be 100%
compatible with single-channel AD4030-like parts. We would be writing code to
support AD4030 _and_ a peculiar data stream from this specific HDL project?

My suggestion is to apply all patches except patch 8. IMHO, SPI offload
single-channel ADC support is broken due to HDL IP data stream not being
compatible with single-channel parts. That's not a Linux driver issue.
Patch 8 (common-mode for single-channel) may be fine, but I haven't been able
to validate that since I only have remote access to a single-channel ADC that
has already required a buffer work around to test.
