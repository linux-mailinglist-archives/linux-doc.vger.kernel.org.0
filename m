Hm, ok. If ISA strings are likely to be written that way, then I agree
having the kernel flip on all the contained extensions is a good idea.
We can tweak patch 2 to support the parsing of struct
riscv_isa_ext_data with both .id and .bundle_size set (instead of only
one or the other as it is now). Looking back at that patch, it looks
quite doable. Alright!
