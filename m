There appears to be no standard way for attaching a program to an interface, it still seems customary to write your own custom loader. Where would the user run this loader? In Debian likely in a post up hook with ifupdown, in Fedora one would have to write a locally custom dispatcher script (assuming Network Manager) that only ran the loader for a given interface. In short I do not see a reasonably appropriate way to deploy an eBPF program to users with the current infrastructure. Also, I am not aware of the bpf syscall supporting signed program loading. Signing kernel modules seems popular with some distros to identify limits of support and authentication of an unmodified system. I suspect similar bpf support might be needed to identify support and authentication for deployed programs.

Input from others would be helpful, I cannot claim eBPF is an inferior 
technical solution to this proposed solution. So if this bonding option 
approach is the wrong path, would like to know sooner rather than later 
to attempt another path. I am by no means an expert on eBPF, I know how 
to spell it, I do know there were support issues when considering the 
eBPF option.

I will post my v3 to continue the technical review, but I think the 
"should we even do this" review should be continued here.
