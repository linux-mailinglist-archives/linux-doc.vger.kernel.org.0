I think history is pretty important for understanding concepts, otherwise
they appear as not invented but emergent. However the question about
what is important and what is trivia is a question of professional technica=
l
writing. The documentation maintainer works with technical writing and
can decide the value of this.

You are right I should reword this to be about memory accesses, I
might have missed some of your feedback so I will go back and check
what you said.

Thanks dropping it.

I guess the word is a byproduct of doing too much cross compiling...

Please refarain from using this kind of unproffessional wording in your
professional communication. Be technical, precise and to the point and do
not use value statements.

Your statement is incorrect. Your feedback is seen as valuable
and it is read, reacted on and incorporated.

I did rewrite the document thoroughly in reaction to your comments,
and in order so you feel respected I am going to illustrate.

You wrote:

Which I took as a good suggestion, and the paragraph is rewritten
from this (which you criticized):

To this (current wording):

nced
> by the underlying physical page frame. The **page frame number** or **pfn=
**

Which obviously includes some of your wording (divided by PAGE_SIZE etc).
I also got review comments from other reviewers and that is reflected in th=
e
current wording.

You wrote:

And this was changed to what you suggested, and it was a pretty
fundamental and important change.

You wrote:

And this was changed to exactly what you suggested.

You wrote:

> array, not list

And this was changed (everywhere) to what you suggested.

You wrote:

And the document now includes this (Mike Rapoport made the same
comment).

So your claim that "Much of my last review was ignored." is simply
incorrect. It was not ignored, rather it has thoroughly shaped the document=
.

Yours,
Linus Walleij
