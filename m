I appreciate the questions. I sense there may be some confusion over who th=

The design of the Linux kernel is emergent. This is a fundamental property =

the way it is developed, and the source of its greatest strength. But it ha=

some shortcomings that place a burden on kernel maintainers, all kernel
testing, and even people who wish to contribute.

We intend this as a tool to address those areas.

You are correct, the kernel has succeeded over many decades, and will conti=

succeeding for many decades to come.

With the exception of some very narrow situations, the emergent design (or
"nuanced complexity" if you prefer that term) of the Linux kernel is not
communicated in a broadly consistent way. This affects the way the kernel i=
s
tested, and also the way it is developed. Even veteran kernel maintainers a=

tripping over nuance and complexity.

Exactly zero. This is not for regulators.

As this is not intended for regulators, it is not clear to me that catering=
 to
their desires would be a good use of anyone's time.

I say this as a software engineer who works in a _highly_ regulated industr=
y,
and who knows the relevant regulations quite well. There are good ideas bur=
ied
in those regulations, but (in their default form) they are _not_ appropriat=
e
for the Linux kernel development process.

The intent is to allow for a separate maintainer path. There is more to it =
than
that, but I do not want to bury the lede here.

Well, I am sorry for that. I am not quite sure how to respond, but I certai=
nly
sympathize with past frustrations. I have plenty of my own.

We are not offering a silver bullet here, and the work to describe the kern=
el's
design will be finished when the work of development is finished. This is j=
ust
an attempt to fill in a semantic gap that is responsible for a great deal o=
f
technical debt and maintainer burnout.

It is not clear to me what customers you are talking about. That is certain=
ly
not a goal in the mind of anyone working on this project that I am aware of=
.

I respect what you are saying here, and perhaps the point of confusion came
from the safety related source? As is often the case in science and
engineering, we are borrowing (and _heavily_ modifying) a technique that is
found in a different domain.

The intent is to target technical debt and maintainer burnout by filling in=
 a
semantic gap that occurs when a human idea is turned into code. Ironically,
this is why the safety regulations were written in the first place, but lit=
tle
consideration was given to development methodology during that process.

Thank you,
