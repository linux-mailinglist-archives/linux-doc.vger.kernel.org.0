Isn't this (almost) the same relationship I introduce with the GPUVA 
manager?

If you would switch over to the GPUVA manager right now, it would be 
that every GEM has a list of it's mappings (the gpuva list). The mapping 
is represented by struct drm_gpuva (of course embedded in driver 
specific structure(s)) which has a pointer to the VM address space it is 
part of, namely the GPUVA manager instance. And the GPUVA manager keeps 
a maple tree of it's mappings as well.

If you still would like to *directly* (indirectly you already have that 
relationship) keep a list of GPUVA managers (VM address spaces) per GEM, 
you could still do that in a driver specific way.

Do I miss something?

They could still remain to be driver specific then, right?

I fully agree, that's why I wrote "the common case should be that in a 
VA space at least every mapping *being backed by a BO* is represented by 
a struct drm_gpuva".

Mappings not being backed by an actual BO would not be linked to a GEM 
of course.

As explained above, I think that's exactly what the GPUVA manager does, 
just in another order:

BO has list of mappings, mappings have pointer to VM, VM has list (or 
actually a maple tree) of mappings.

You see any advantages or disadvantages of either order of 
relationships? For me it looks like it doesn't really matter which one 
to pick.
