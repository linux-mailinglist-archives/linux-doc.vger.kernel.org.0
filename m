Well, I've just done it again:

- Patch submitted sends a patch series that uses some of my code
- I review the series, and spot deficiencies in it which can be
  solved by patching my code to add additional functionality.
- I create a patch for my code, and send it as a reply to that
  thread.  The discussion in the thread is entirely relevant to
  the patch.
- They review it and decide whether or not it solves their problem
  and whether they want to use that approach.
- If successful, I send it "officially" as an entirely separate
  thread.
- Maybe Andrew Lunn reviews it and sends a reviewed-by tag.
- DaveM applies it and sends an "applied" message.

With Link: pointing at the "official" submission, all the context
behind why the patch was necessary gets lost.

With Link: pointing at the email in the original discussion that
contained the patch proposal, the discussion for the patch (including
all the things that you're talking about) get properly linked to.
So, I would much rather have Link: pointing to this discussion rather
than a useless "it was reviewed and applied" set of emails, which we
know anyway from the attributation tags that are on the commit.

I guess with your workflow is along the lines of:

- Patch gets officially submitted
- Patch gets reviewed and some discussion happens
- Result of the discussion is to apply the patch
- Patch gets applied with Link: to the official submission

which does seem appropriate to ensure that the Link: tag is added
when the patch is applied.
