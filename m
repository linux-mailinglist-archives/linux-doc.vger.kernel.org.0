I'll add to the "auto-movable" description:

"This policy ignores the ``movable_node`` kernel command line parameter 
and isn't really applicable in environments that require it (e.g., bare 
metal with hotunpluggable nodes) where hotplugged memory might be 
exposed via the firmware-provided memory map early during boot to the 
system instead of getting detected, added and onlined later during boot 
(such as done by virito-mem or by some hypervisors implementing emulated 
DIMMs)."

Thanks Mike!
