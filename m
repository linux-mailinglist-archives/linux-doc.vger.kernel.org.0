It does sound like sysfs could be made to work for us, but it's
definitely a workaround.  If the normal way to set these values was
through sysfs then it would be fine, but I think most people expect
that these values are just setup properly by the kernel.  That means
anyone using our board with a different userspace (someone running
upstream on it) would need to figure out what mechanism they were
going to use to program them.  There's very little advantage here
compared to a downstream patch that just violates official upstream
policy by putting something bogoWatts based in the device tree.

My current plan of record (which I don't love) is basically:

1. Before devices are in consumer's hands, accept bogoWatts numbers in
our downstream kernel.

2. Once devices are in consumers hands, run the script I sent out to
generate some numbers and post them upstream.

If, at some point, there's a better solution then I'll switch to it,
but until then that seems workable even if it makes me grumpy.
