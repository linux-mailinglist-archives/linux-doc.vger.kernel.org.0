These are not small 'very small changes'.

We're nearly at rc-5, and this is a major, invasive, dangerous change that
we have to get right.

You've also made changes unrelated to review, repeatedly, throughout this
process, which as I've told you, is causing delays.

You've also throughout the review of this series done stuff like make MAJOR
changes to things and _kept review tags_.

You're forcing us to use git range-diff etc. to forensically check that the
series is what is claimed.

Dude I mean you switched to using // comment style which is not used in mm
anywhere for instance? Don't do things like that and complain about
delays. Honestly.

Also, again, LSF happened. Other confeerences happened. Bandwidth is
reduced.

So again, I'm sorry, but you've been hit with some bad luck here.

I really wanted this in for 7.2, and I feel bad that we couldn't make it,
but you're also doing thing that's making it difficult for us.

I've spent double-digits hours on your series, and I've also had work
pushed out becasue of that leading me to work evenings and weekends as a
result.

And I'm not even going to get any credit for it :))

So while I sypmathise, really, please have empathy and realise it goes both
ways, please.

I'm not being mean for the sake of it, I'm pushing back because I feel this
is not at a stage where I'd feel confident in this being merged at this
time.

And it's very much a regret, as I _really_ wanted us to have it in this
time. But life and circumstances and the issues mentioned above have
intervened, sadly.

The issue wasn't the error (though it wasn't tiny...!), it's the state of
review. There was fresh review comments from a few days ago, and there's
big diffs between revisions.

You've also made unrelated changes as you have done throughout the series.

As I said above, I'm sorry that you spent time in your PTO on this, but we
cannot rush this in when things are not clearly ready yet, and I am not
confident in this being ready at this stage.

I mean, sure there's clearly confusion here as you sent [PATCH 7.2 v16 ...]
(against an unreleased kernel version) then a branch specifier then the
hotfixes one...

Anyway sure, it's fine, I've made vastly more dumb mistakes than that
myself, nobody minds, but it's concerning as by convention [PATCH
... <mm->hotfixes<whatever>] generally is taken to mean 'please rush this
to hotfixes!' :)

So be careful with that please!

I've explained the why above, and David and I co-maintain THP so I feel
that ultimately given the blood, sweat and tears we've put into THP review
we ought to have some input on this :)

Thanks, Lorenzo
