Hmm, looks like you were suffered from context mismatch.

My message you tried to understand (archived at:

    https://lore.kernel.org/5031e0c4-f17e-41b8-8955-959989e797f2@gmail.com/

) started this way:

    Hi, (just got v8, but sending anyway ...),

, and the message assumed the "make pdfdocs" behavior of v7.

At the time, I thought it was what you had intended and it looked as though
you wanted latexmk/xelatex to continue running as much as possible ignoring
any intermediate errors.

You have since fixed the missed exception handling at the latexdocs phase,
but your rapid respins of this series simply overwhelmed me and I have
failed to see "make pdfdocs" now gives up at latexdocs error.

My intention of mentioning GNU Make's options of -i, -k, etc. in the message
was to show you that the make--sub-make scheme is so flexible and it can
even emulate the buggy behavior of then sphinx-build-wrapper.

In normal cases, I won't use any of those options.
But as a human developer, I sometimes use them when I observe build errors
somewhere in "make pdfdocs".

Didn't you mean "if latexdocs is not build"?
Yes, I now see this is the current behavior.

No, as I said above, I don't want it in most cases.
But in rare occasions, I might want it.  That depends on the situation
at hand.

OK. This looks like the way forward to me.

I'll prepare a patch (set) and submit it after v6.18-rc1.

In the meantime, I think we might be better off if we could root-cause
the "latexmk bug" you repeatedly claimed you had observed, without providing
any steps to reproduce.

Let me continue in another thread.
It would be far more interesting for me to (try to) figure out what you
had observed.

Thanks,
Akira
