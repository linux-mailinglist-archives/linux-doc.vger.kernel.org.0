Although personally I prefer to add interleave weight as an attribute of
nodes.  I understand that some people think it's not appropriate to
place anything node-specific there.  So, some place under /sys/kernel/mm
sounds reasonable too.

Yes.  That is the target use case.

That is nice.  And I prefer to emphasize the simple use case.  Users
don't need to specify interleave weight always.  Just use
MPOL_WEIGHTED_INTERLEAVE policy, and system will provide reasonable
default weight.

The matrix stuff makes the situation complex.  If people do need
something like that, they can just use set_memorypolicy2() with user
specified weights.  I still believe that "make simple stuff simple, and
complex stuff possible".

Thanks for doing all these!
