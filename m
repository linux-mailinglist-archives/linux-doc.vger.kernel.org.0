So the bottom line is that UTF-8 in the files will stay, and Sphinx
cannot handle UTF-8 when the locale is not UTF-8.

In the long run it might be nice to fix Sphinx to properly set the
encoding of the files it reads and writes. Or maybe there is some
parameter that specifies it?

For the short term I think it is reasonable to run a python test script
that prints fancy unicode characters before running Sphinx and bail if
the test script fails.

eg.
echo 'print("↑ᛏ个")' > test.py
python3 test.py
