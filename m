Hi Paul, Blaise,

Thanks for clarifying, that matches my understanding.

My read is Hornet's semantic goal is load-time provenance and
integrity: validate the user-generated inputs once the kernel has
constructed the final in-kernel program instance (post-relocation,
with any integrity-relevant referenced inputs accounted for), and
record that result so LSM/policy can make decisions based on a fact
the kernel can truthfully assert.

Attaching and linking are separate runtime policy/capability
questions. It makes sense that SELinux, IPE, or a BPF LSM program
could choose to gate attach/link based on whether Hornet recorded the
program as verified, but that enforcement is orthogonal to Hornet's
core integrity/provenance objective.

Thanks
