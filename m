Adding feature A because people don't want to (! whoever the "people" 
are) enable feature B? I hope I don't have to tell you what I think 
about statements like this :)

If feature B is a problem, try stripping it down such that it can be 
enabled. If it's to hard to configure for your use case, maybe we can 
extend configuration options to avoid tools like daxctl for some special 
cases.

But of course, only if feature B actually solves the problem.

One issue I have with DMB is actual use cases / users / requirements. 
Maybe requirements are defined somewhere cleanly and I missed them.

If we have clear requirements, we can talk about possible solutions. If 
we have a specific solution, it's harder to talk about requirements.

Let me clarify what ZONE_MOVABLE can and cannot do:

* We cannot assume that specific user space allocations are served from
   it, neither can we really modify behavior.
* We cannot assume that user space allocations won't be migrated off
   that zone to another zone.
* We cannot assume that no other (kernel) allocations will end up on it.
* We cannot make specific processes preferably consume memory from it.

Designing a feature that relies on any of these assumptions is IMHO wrong.

If you want an application to consume memory from a specific address 
range, there are some possible ways I can see:

(1) Model the special memory areas using fake NUMA nodes. e.g., mbind()
     the applications to these nodes. Use ZONE_MOVABLE to make sure we
     don't get unmovable allocations. The buddy will take care of it.
(2) Use some driver that manages that memory and provides that memory
     to an application by mmap()'ing it. The buddy won't manage it (no
     swap, migration ...). DEVDAX is one possible such driver.
(3) Use hugetlb and reserve them from the selected memory ranges.
     Make the application consume these hugetlb pages.

For a single node, without a special driver, it gets more complicated: 
We'd need new way to tell the buddy that these memory ranges are 
"special". I don't want to use the word "new zone" but that's most 
likely what it would have to be. Further, one would need a way to 
specify that only specific allocations should end up on these ranges.

Maybe I'm overthinking this. Having clear requirements such that we can 
try discussing solutions and exploring alternatives would be great.
