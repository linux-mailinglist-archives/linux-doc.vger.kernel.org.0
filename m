Thanks for the clarification. I think I should now know what to for the 
GPUVA manager in terms of locking the maple tree in general.

Though I still have very limited insights on the maple tree I want to 
share some further thoughts.

 From what I got so far it really seems to me that it would be better to 
just take the internal spinlock for both APIs (normal and advanced) 
whenever you need to internally.

This way users would not need to take care of locking maple tree 
internals, which I still think is a little odd.

Another plus would probably be maintainability. Once you got quite a few 
maple tree users using external locks (either in the sense of calling 
mt_set_external_lock() or in the way I'll potentially do it by using the 
internal lock with the advanced API and an additional external lock) it 
might be hard to apply any changes to the locking requirements, because 
you would either need to check every users implementation by hand or be 
able to run it in order to check it with lockdep.

If I got this correctly (please tell me if I don't) the only reason the 
internal lock is not managed by the advanced API internally is to let 
users do more complex transactions, without the need of having a 
separate external lock, as long as they fulfill the locking requirements 
of the maple tree, which are enforced by lockdep.

However, you already mentioned that "acquiring/releasing the uncontended 
spinlock is a minimal cost compared to all the other things that will 
happen while modifying the tree".

Do I miss something?

Just asking lockdep was my plan already, however I thought I still 
better ask. :D

If you will keep the current approach of handling the internal lock I 
think its necessary to somewhere document where users need to take the 
lock and, even more important, where the maple tree implementation will 
drop the lock.

For instance, if I would rely on using the internal spinlock for locking 
sets of transactions to the maple tree this would cause nasty bugs if I 
use functions like mas_store_gfp() dropping the lock. Even though I must 
admit that this is not a great example, since it should raise some red 
flags if a user would expect a spinlock is held for a sleeping 
allocation without questioning it. However, you get the point I guess.
