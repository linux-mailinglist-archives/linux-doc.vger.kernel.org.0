What are the inc_return() cases? If they're not "safe" to use inc() and
then read(), then those likely need a closer look at what they're doing.

If you want to distinguish from atomic and create a wrapping "int", how
about making "counter" be the atomic and name the other "counter_unsafe"
(or "counter_best_effort", "counter_simple", ...) etc?
