Greg, please use olof@lixom.net on the patch, I try to keep LKML out
of my non-upstream inbox. :-)


Alexei was part of the discussion, and from others in the same room it
sounded like there are no users of the upstream version of this
feature. Posting this patch is the obvious way to find out if that is
the case.

I.e. even if there was a version of bcc that required this, it sounds
like the BTF approach is significantly better and said users are
hopefully moving forward to it quickly, and if they can't move
forward, then they're likely also not going to move forward to newer
kernels either?
