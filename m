I think this would be a happy world, but I wonder what others think.
Anyway, I'm looking forward to the future direction.

Broadly speaking, there are two main ideas:
1. Swap I/O buffering (which is also tied to cluster management issues)
2. Deduplication

Are you leaning towards the view that these two should be placed in a
higher layer?

I initially thought implementing this in vswap would be complicated
(due to the ripple effects of altering behavior at swap_writeout timing),
but it seems entirely possible!

1. We could change the behavior (e.g., buffering) at vswap_alloc_swap_slot
   timing by checking things like the si type.
2. Additionally, if we can handle the cluster data structures and
   mechanisms in the swap_info_struct privately, a virtual-to-physical
   one-direction approach seems feasible.
   (Come to think of it, it might be better to refactor the infra to let
   other modules handle this, potentially removing the swap_info_struct
   mechanism entirely. Just imagination ;) )

As for reference count management, applying it loosely might be a good
approach. Instead of strictly managing the lifecycle of the dedup contents
with refcounts, we could just periodically clean up the hash. This also
has the benefit of reducing I/O for the same swap content compared to
deleting it immediately.

Since our private swap device is similar to ZRAM, I hadn't considered
the charging aspect. It is indeed a complex issue.

If it goes into ZSWAP, there would definitely be a clear advantage of
seeing dedup benefits across all swap devices. It's a technically
interesting area, and I'd like to discuss it in a separate thread if
I have more ideas or thoughts.

Just a thought that comes to mind here: if vswap becomes modularized,
how about doing memcg charging for this entire area? 
(Come to think of it, to fully benefit from vswap modularization,
zswap should also be applied within its scope.)

Best regards,
