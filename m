EIP is the x86-32 name for what x86-64 calls RIP.  Not much help in
this case, because it's pointing to a userspace address (actually, I
think it's the vdso).

That's the important bit.  Your task tried to take a mutex and 480
seconds later, it still didn't have it.

The mutex it tried to take was in the function do_journal_begin_r().
Best of luck debugging reiserfs problems these days.  It doesn't get
a lot of love.
