From: Steven Rostedt <rostedt@goodmis.org>

The histogram documentation describes the old method of the histogram
triggers using the fn() field of the histogram field structure to process
the field. But due to Spectre mitigation, the function pointer to handle
the fields at runtime caused a noticeable overhead. It was converted over
to a fn_num and hist_fn_call() is now used to call the specific functions
for the fields via a switch statement based on the field's fn_num value.

Update the documentation to reflect this change.
