 The string array type is a bit different from other types. For other base

 represents "char array", but string array type represents "char * array".

 Bitfield is another special type, which takes 3 parameters, bit-width, bit-
 offset, and container-size (usually 32). The syntax is::
 
  b<bit-width>@<bit-offset>/<container-size>
 
-Symbol type('symbol') is an alias of u32 or u64 type (depends on BITS_PER_LONG)

 The user-space dereference syntax allows you to access a field of a data
-structure in user-space. This is done by adding the "u" prefix to the
-dereference syntax. For example, +u4(%si) means it will read memory from the
-address in the register %si offset by 4, and the memory is expected to be in
-user-space. You can use this for strings too, e.g. +u0(%si):string will read
-a string from the address in the register %si that is expected to be in user-
-space. 'ustring' is a shortcut way of performing the same task. That is,
-+0(%si):ustring is equivalent to +u0(%si):string.

 Per-Probe Event Filtering
