Hm yeah rgb332 palette sounds like a reasonable idea. Could even have that
palette defined/generated in format conversion helpers, and then an
xrgb8888->rgb332 converter.

Lower palettes probably stop making sense as rgb, maybe there we just do
greyscale or something like that for the xrgb8888 emulation.
