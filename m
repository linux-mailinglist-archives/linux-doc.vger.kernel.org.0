So these seem about ready to apply, but ... they never made it to a
public list.  I see linux-doc in the headers, but somehow your messages
didn't actually get there.

Could I ask you to resend, fixing whatever it was that prevented the
messages from getting onto linux-doc last time?  While you are at it,
you can also send them as a proper series with a cover letter and fix
the additional URL that Federico pointed out in part 2.

Thanks,

jon
