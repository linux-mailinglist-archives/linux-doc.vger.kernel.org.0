When I read the document I thought that new features are not accepted
at all, so I took into consideration making a custom fix for stable.
But that would have been worse, as it implied forking the stable and
would have made backporting additional fixes harder. An explicit rule
like this would have saved me few emails changed and few hours spent on
looking for an alternative fix. But maybe others find this a
common sense implied rule and you won't have to be summoned for it
anymore.

Okay, as you prefer.
