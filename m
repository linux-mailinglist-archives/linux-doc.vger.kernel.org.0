What is the relationship between those two attributes?

Is existence (and compatibility) of (1) a pre-req for possible
existence (and compatibility) of (2)?

Does userspace need to check (1) or can it completely rely on (2), if
it so chooses?

If devices with a different mdev type are indeed compatible, it seems
userspace can only find out after the devices have actually been
created, as (1) does not apply?

One of my worries is that the existence of an attribute with the same
name in two similar locations might lead to confusion. But maybe it
isn't a problem.
