Would you be interested in me trying to initiate a new "threat-model.rst"
file that tries to unroll the points mentioned in the list ? I'm concerned
that that withuot having many details initially, it could look a bit odd,
because the list we currently have would be more suitable for an "other"
section.

Yes, OK, but we want them in any case. That's the idea I tried to convey
in the proposed doc (maybe not well enough), basically "this is a bug and
it is worth reporting, but no need to involve s@k.o for this".
