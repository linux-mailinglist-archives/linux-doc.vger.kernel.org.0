Hi Dmitry,

I've done a bit of a deep dive into this to try and get it to work
without work queues while using PROBE_PREFER_ASYNCHRONOUS and regular
sleeps. While it does simplify the driver, I can't get it to function
properly. No matter how long I wait the probe fails with an -EBUSY as
raw_event never fires during the probe context, and my completion
handler times out. The most likely explanation I have found is that
the MCU must require all interfaces to be fully bound before it will
respond to interrupt URB completions (vice needing to sleep for 500ms
for the MCU to be ready as I previously thought). During probe the
driver core holds the parent USB device lock for the duration of each
interface's probe. Since the other interfaces cannot start binding as
they are blocked waiting for the parent lock, and the MCU is waiting
for them to bind before responding, no ACK arrives within the timeout
window and the probe fails. The other interfaces only begin probing
after the config interface probe returns and releases the parent lock,
as confirmed by dmesg timestamps. When using the work_queue method all
interfaces have finished probing, so the MCU is responding to
interrupt URB completions and everything works.

Since a lock is held on the parent while each interface is attached,
and USB devices have multiple interfaces, this happens synchronously
even in "async" context. The HID core calls driver_attach, which
detects the async flag and calls __driver_attach_async_helper, which
then calls driver_probe_device after locking the parent.

From drivers/base/dd.c:
static void __driver_attach_async_helper(void *_dev, async_cookie_t cookie)
{
    struct device *dev =3D _dev;
    const struct device_driver *drv;
    int ret;

    __device_driver_lock(dev, dev->parent);
    drv =3D dev->p->async_driver;
    dev->p->async_driver =3D NULL;
    ret =3D driver_probe_device(drv, dev);
    __device_driver_unlock(dev, dev->parent);

    dev_dbg(dev, "driver %s async attach completed: %d\n", drv->name, ret);

    put_device(dev);
}
...
 * driver_probe_device - attempt to bind device & driver together
...
 * This function must be called with @dev lock held.  When called for a
 * USB interface, @dev->parent lock must be held as well.

One possible solution might be to add a way to match on
bInterfaceNumber in hid_device_id and allow the interfaces I don't
care about to stay bound to hid_generic. Another would be to
parallelize the interface probing. I'm not sure about the feasibility
of either approach since they would have significant changes and broad
implications for all USB/USBHID drivers. I also don't know if that
would even solve the problem.

Thanks,
Derek
