So, I think I have figured out what causes those "WARNING: Duplicate
C declaration".

When you have kernel-doc comments for both struct and function
of the same name, recent Sphinx emits this warning.

Although Sphinx versions 1.7.9 and 2.4.4 don't complain, the result
is the same with Sphinx 3.x and 4.x (with the fix to kernel-doc Mauro
mentioned above).

I have no idea which version of Sphinx is employed for building pages at
https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/driver-api/80211/mac80211.html,
but the cross reference to the ieee80211_tx_status() function in the
description of ieee80211_rx_ni() points to struct ieee80211_tx_status,
which is not an expected behavior.

In this case, it seems to me that both the struct and function
kernel-doc comments are included by the kernel-doc directive

.. kernel-doc:: include/net/mac80211.h
   :functions:
	ieee80211_rx_status
        [...]

at Documentation/driver-api/80211/mac80211.rst:109.

As the :functions: option is identical to :identifiers:, both of
kernel-doc comments in mac80211.h, namely:

    include/net/mac80211.h:1148: * struct ieee80211_tx_status - extended tx status info for rate control

    include/net/mac80211.h:4813: * ieee80211_tx_status - transmit status callback

are extracted by the kerneldoc extension (or the kernel-doc script).

Mauro, does your earlier comment:
>> Another consequence of such change is that you can't have more than
>> one "read()" function inside the entire Kernel. 

apply to those struct and functions of the identical name?

I just want to know what is the expected behavior in this case.

Note: Line counts in this mail are those of v5.18-rc7.

        Thanks, Akira
