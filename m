Shrug. Anshuman wrote the pr_debugs. I wrote this part. Honestly, I
don't know why you'd want them only once if they are gated off by
debug. I guess since other cases of rejecting events outside this
function have pr_debug() we should do the same here.

I know it is allowed(on x86), but why would we want that? If you do
something even more restricted:

perf record -e cycles:k -j any,u -- true

That's allowed on x86 and gives you samples with user addresses. But
all the events happened in the kernel. How does that make any sense?

I suppose in your example, we could avoid attaching branch stack on
samples from the kernel. However, given how my example works, I'm
pretty sure that's not what x86 does.

There's also combinations that are allowed, but record no samples.
Though I think that was with guest events. I've gone with reject
non-sense combinations as much as possible. We can easily remove those
restrictions later if needed. Changing the behavior later (for the
same configuration) wouldn't be good.

Yes, I plan to update that if we keep this behavior.

Well, left over from when all the Arm specific types were supported.
So yeah, that can be simplified.

My read of that was we should see a CALL in this case. Whether SVC
generates a TRAP or CALL depends on HFGITR_EL2.SVC_EL0 (table D18-2).
I assumed "SVC due to HFGITR_EL2.SVC_EL0" means when SVC_EL0 is set
(and set has additional conditions). We have SVC_EL0 cleared, so that
should be a CALL. Maybe the FVP has this wrong?

Yes, agreed.
