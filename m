Hi!

Thank you all for your advice.

I'll start with Documentation/process, as Jonathan suggested. After=20
that doc-guide and translations, especially Chinese (I read
Chinese) and Japanese (currently learning Japanese).

(Are there any other documents that I should read?)

I think this will be enough reading until the beginning of September
when new school year starts.

I talked with one of our English teachers today and she was very
enthusiastic about my plan to involve our students in the translation
of a kernel documentation.

Of course, I intend to maintain Slovenian translation.

The helpdesk was helpdesk@kernel.org=20

Best regards,

Matic Urbanija

As has already been said, this is the right place.

Out of curiosity, which "helpdesk" did you send email to?

Best is to look at how the other languages are handled. =C2=A0I would
recommend starting with the stuff in Documentation/process/ as being of
the most general interest.

If you can recruit somebody else to help with review of translation
patches, that would be most helpful. =C2=A0On my own, I'm not qualified to
know what's a good translation and what isn't.

I do have to ask one question: is it your intent to maintain this
translation once it has gone upstream? =C2=A0Documentation evolves over tim=
e;
having a bunch of out-of-date translations in the tree is not
particularly useful. =C2=A0I'll be a lot happier about accepting a new
translation if I have some assurance that it will not end up in that
state.

Thanks,

jon
