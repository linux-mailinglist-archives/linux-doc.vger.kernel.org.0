I fully understand that.

Well, I believe I already take a faire share in reviewing and
maintaining the subsystem :-) I even started getting a look into spi-nor
patches recently since I ramped up on the subsystem.

Michel and Tudor regularly make useful feedback, Takahiro is ramping up,
I try to keep enough availability for maintaining NAND, SPI NAND and
anything that is MTD but not in one of the three main subsystems. I
don't think we are in a bad maintainership situation.

Applying series partially is okay; specifically for this series,
patches 1-8 could have been taken alone, but a bit earlier IMHO.

Just to be clear, I am not asking for a fast path here. We need to
follow the contribution and review model, because that is the saniest
model that worked well for us until now. I am however opposed to the
statut quo situation that was progressively settling because of the lack
of availability.

Also, I am always following closely when patches get applied, so I can
respond quickly in case of breakage.

Thanks for your work Pratyush, don't get me wrong, your work is highly
appreciated, and your availability is a parameter we will comply with.

Cheers ;-)
