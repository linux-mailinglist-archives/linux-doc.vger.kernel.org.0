The writeback option is about interacting with other swap backends. So
technically it is not zswap alone. writeback =3D 0 will disable SSD swap
as well.
I am not against merging the write back. I just want to make sure 1)
better alternatives can be developed 2) zswap.writeback can obsolete
if a better alternative is available.

Great to hear that. I think the discussion so far shows the
alternative usage cases of the swap backend/tires is real.

Care to elaborate it more? I don't understand the conflict part. I do
ask Johannes in my previous email for clarification.
One is the superset of the other. I don't consider that as a conflict.
If we can have both to choose from, obviously I would pick the one
that is more general and flexible.
