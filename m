reading/writing page tables is the real problem.

See below, that's unfortunately not sufficient.

I'm certainly not going to yell :) But unfortunately I'll have to tell 
you that what you are doing is in my understanding fundamentally broken.

See, page tables might get removed any time
a) By munmap() code even while holding the mmap semaphore in read (!)
b) By khugepaged holding the mmap lock in write mode

The rules are (ignoring the rmap side of things)

a) You can walk page tables inside a known VMA with the mmap semaphore 
held in read mode. If you drop the mmap sem, you have to re-validate the 
VMA! Anything could have changed in the meantime. This is essentially 
what mm/pagewalk.c does.

b) You can walk page tables ignoring VMAs with the mmap semaphore held 
in write mode.

c) You can walk page tables lockless if the architecture supports it and 
you have interrupts disabled the hole time. But you are not allowed to 
write.

With what you're doing, you might end up reading random garbage as page 
table pointers, or writing random garbage to pages that are no longer 
used as page tables.

Take a look at mm/gup.c:lockless_pages_from_mm() to see how difficult it 
is to walk page tables lockless. And it only works because page table 
freeing code synchronizes either via IPI or fake-rcu before actually 
freeing a page table.

follow_invalidate_pte() is, in general, the wrong thing to use. It's 
specialized to VM_IO and VM_PFNMAP. take a look at the difference in 
complexity between follow_invalidate_pte() and mm/pagewalk.c!

I'm really sorry, but as far as I can tell, this is locking-wise broken 
and follow_invalidate_pte() is the wrong interface to use here.

Someone can most certainly correct me if I'm wrong, or if I'm missing 
something regarding your implementation, but if you take a look around, 
you won't find any code walking page tables without at least holding the 
mmap sem in read mode -- for a good reason.
