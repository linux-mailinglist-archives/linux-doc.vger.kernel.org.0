It's not about embedded systems, it's about shitty, inconsistent,
closed-source bootloaders. If bootloaders weren't enabling far more than
they require and / or if we could fix them when they do, we wouldn't
have more clocks enabled than we need to.

Removing clk_ignore_unused will just make end users pissed off because
of the higher power draw.

I have no problem with *replacing* it with something better. I looked at
that talk already, tried to make sync_state work already and suggested
it to Brian too. So I'm not saying it shouldn't replaced.

What I have a problem with is removing it with no viable alternative in
sight.

I'm glad we're in violent agreement then :)
